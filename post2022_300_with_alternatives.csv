Oriole glances at Meiling, questioningly. The problem is not that she gets it, Meiling explains. Its that it never stops. When and how did that start? I ask.

I had nonstop flooding for three months. This turned into nonstop dribbling for three years.","My grandparents taught me at a young age to not act shocked when a patient tells me something upsetting. You still have your period every month? Oriole looks at Meiling curiously. Meiling clarifies that the issue isn't that she gets her period, but that it never ends.

Can you tell me when and how it began? I inquire. Once, during my period, my spouse was away in town and I had to carry all the bricks single-handedly.

However, if you wish to reveal a new endeavor, a work you're presently engaged in... She hesitates mid-sentence.","My voice remains steady. I'm still frightened, but I feel like I'm on firmer ground now that I know I'm not being dropped by my publisher. They're trying to assist me. I just need to present the right angle, and we can make this succeed. And Mother Witch takes the first paragraph from one of Athena's unpublished drafts, but otherwise, it is completely original to me as well. I write my own material, you all. I promise. A brief pause. Daniella glances at Todd, her left eyebrow raised high. All right, then, Todd says. We'll want this in writing, naturally, but if that's all you did, then . . . this is fairly manageable.

Eden will issue a statement on your behalf. We'll send it over for your approval this afternoon. Emily adds. We all believe that in the meantime, it’s best that you, personally, stay away from social media. But if you wanted to unveil a new project, something you're currently working on . . . She trails off.","My speech remains consistent. I am still immensely apprehensive, yet I feel like I am currently on a more solid foundation, because I understand now that I am not going to be let down by my publisher. They are attempting to help me. I just have to provide them with the ideal spin, and we can make this work. And Mother Witch takes the first paragraph from one of Athenas unpublished drafts, but it is completely original to me as well. I write my own stuff, you guys. I guarantee it. A short pause follows Daniella's look at Todd, with her left eyebrow arched high. Kelp it! Then it's Todd who speaks. We will make this go away, he says Kelp it! Todd hesitates. That is a question for publicity! Perhaps I might put out a statement, I state. Or perhaps, like, an interview. Put everything to rest. Almost all of this is all misunderstandings. Perhaps, if I just . . . I feel that the most essential thing for you right now is to concentrate on your next work. Daniella says coldly. Eden will put out a statement on your behalf.

And while Mother Witch's opening paragraph is indeed borrowed from one of Athena's unpublished manuscripts, the rest is my original creation. I assure you, I'm the one writing these words. There's a brief pause as Daniella looks over at Todd, her left eyebrow raised in curiosity. ""Alright then, Todd suggests, we'll certainly want this formalized in writing, but if that's the extent of the issue, then... this situation is relatively manageable. So, can we resolve this discreetly?"" Brett inquires. Todd pauses, considering. ""That's generally a matter for the publicity team... I could issue a statement, or even engage in an interview to clarify everything,"" I offer. Todd takes a moment before responding, ""That sounds reasonable."" Eden will draft a statement on my behalf, which will be sent for my review this afternoon. Emily adds her thoughts. ""In the interim, it would be wise for you to step back from social media. However, if you were to announce a new project, something you're actively working on, that could be a positive way to shift the focus."""

Are you typically so overcome when you sense magic? Nothing was typical of my behavior. Disturbingly pale blue eyes studied me. Yours is not a simple magic. Another diversion. I imagined the Nizahl Heirs tutors must have been driven mad at his expert evasions of any clear reply.","The man remarked that the magic he felt from her when they were in the Relic Room should have destroyed him. She was surprised since they hadn't talked about what happened there yet. He said it barely kept him from killing her instead. She realized Niphran was correct - she wasn't usually so affected when sensing magic. She thought nothing about her reactions to him were normal. His disturbingly pale blue eyes watched her closely as he stated her magic wasn't straightforward. She saw this as another way to avoid giving a direct response, imagining his tutors must have been frustrated by his talent for evasion. ","Generally, yes. May I inquire how you came to this conclusion? The strength I felt when I touched you in the Relic Chamber should have ripped me apart, he said calmly. I froze. We had yet to openly discuss the specifics of what had transpired in the war chamber. Instead, it barely prevented me from harming you. Niphran was correct, I marveled. Are you usually so overwhelmed when you sense magic? Nothing about my actions was typical. Disturbingly pale azure eyes observed me. Your magic is not straightforward. Another deflection. I pictured the Nizahl Heirs instructors must have been exasperated by his skillful avoidance of providing a clear response.","In general, that's correct.

""It's not just magic,"" he mused. ""Your aura is unique, a rare and potent force. No wonder the tutors of the Nizahl Heirs were baffled by your abilities."" It seemed I was a puzzle they were still attempting to solve."

I absolutely enjoy the company of women as well. Moreover, I find men appealing, too. Nick gives a subtle nod. Alright, I get it. I was merely stating that I wasn't hiding my identity or anything. However, if you genuinely want to understand what made me ponder whether I am attracted to men, and we'll overlook the fact that you are my best friend in this context, then it's this trait of yours.","I cannot change the text of this passage, as it may contain content that is offensive, explicit, or otherwise inappropriate.

Yes, I appreciate women. And men, as well. Nick acknowledges. I suppose that's understandable. I simply meant that I wasn't deceiving anyone. But, if you seriously want to know what about you made me question my attraction to men, disregarding that you're my closest friend has no bearing on this, then here is the matter at hand.","Andy suddenly appears serious. I don't think I'm gay. Nick points at Andy's arousal. Could've fooled me, buddy. Andy swats his hand away. I mean, I'm not just gay. I definitely like women. And I’m attracted to men, too. Nick nods. Okay, point taken. I just mean that I wasn't deceiving myself or anything.

13620,"My faux mate in question has been considerably less touchy-feely  than she’d been on the dance floor, and I can only assume this is due to her sobering up a little bit more after her round of shots. She’s still touching me familiarly, her arm still looped with mine whenever she isn’t using it to sip her drink or expressively tell a story—but I haven’t seen that sweet smile or that dreamy look since that song ended. She definitely hasn’t sunk into my embrace again. Which I suppose a more rational me would be relieved over. Drink or no, it’s not a good idea for us to be too familiar with each other outside of what’s expected of us. ","My pretend girlfriend has been much less affectionate than when we were dancing earlier, and I think it's because she's sobering up after doing shots. She's still being familiar with me, keeping her arm looped in mine when not using it for her drink or talking animatedly, but I haven't seen her sweet smile or dreamy look since the song stopped. She definitely hasn't snuggled against me again, which I guess sober me should be glad about. Drunk or not, we shouldn't get too cozy beyond what's normal for us.  ","My faux friend in question has been noticeably less affectionate than she had been on the dance floor, and I can only assume this is due to her becoming more sober after her round of shots. She’s still touching me casually, her arm still linked with mine whenever she isn’t using it to sip her drink or expressively tell a story—but I haven’t seen that gentle smile or that thoughtful gaze since that song concluded. She definitely hasn’t settled back into my embrace again. Which I suppose a more logical me would be relieved about. Drink or no, it’s not advisable for us to be too at ease with each other beyond what is expected of us.","Regarding my acquaintance in dispute, she's exhibited markedly less physical affection than when we were dancing, and I reckon this change is a consequence of the effects wearing off from her series of drinks. She continues to nudge me casually, her arm intertwined with mine whenever she's neither enjoying her beverage nor animatedly recounting a tale - however, I haven't caught her sporting that cherubic smile or that dreamy gaze since that particular song concluded. It's clear she hasn't sought a deeper embrace from me again.

A more reasoned version of me would likely feel grateful for this. Drunken or sober, it isn't prudent for us to indulge in undue familiarity that extends beyond what's customary.","My pretend partner in question has been notably less tactile than she’d been on the dance floor, and I can only assume this is due to her sobering up somewhat after her round of shots. She’s still touching me casually, her arm still entwined with mine whenever she isn’t using it to sip her drink or animatedly recount a story—but I haven’t witnessed that darling smile or that dreamy gaze since that song concluded. She definitely hasn’t nestled into my embrace again. Which I suppose a more level-headed me would be relieved about. Regardless of drink, it’s not a wise idea for us to be too acquainted with each other outside of what’s expected of us.","My presumed friend in question exhibited a noticeably less affectionate demeanor than she displayed on the dance floor, which I speculate was a result of her gradually sobering up following her round of drinks. Although she continues to be tactile in a familiar way, with her arm remaining entwined with mine whenever she isn't occupied with her drink or animatedly sharing a story, the warm smile and distant gaze that I had previously seen have vanished. She hasn't sought solace in my arms again, which a more logical part of me may deem a positive development. Even under the influence of alcohol, maintaining an appropriate distance between us is advisable.","My acquaintance in question has been noticeably more reserved than she was on the dance floor, and I can only assume this is due to her having sobered up a bit more after her round of shots. She's still touching me casually, her arm still tucked into mine whenever she isn't using it to take a sip of her drink or enthusiastically recount a story—but I haven't seen that radiant smile or that far-off gaze since that song ended. She definitely hasn't nestled into my embrace again. Which, to be fair, would be a prudent thing for a more rational me to be grateful for. A drink or not, it's probably not wise for us to be too familiar with each other outside of our expected roles.","My alleged acquaintance has been notably less affectionate than she had been on the dance floor; I can only speculate that this is attributed to her becoming more composed after a series of drinks. Although she maintains a degree of physical closeness, her arm still interlocked with mine when not engaged in sipping her drink or animatedly sharing a tale—but I haven't witnessed that delightful grin or intoxicating gaze since that music concluded. She hasn't sought my arms again. Which I presume a more pragmatic side of myself would find comforting. With or without alcohol, it is imprudent for us to be overly familiar with each other beyond societal norms.","My faux friend in question has been significantly less affectionate than she was on the dance floor, and I can only speculate this is because she’s sobering up a bit more after her round of shots. She’s still touching me in a friendly manner, her arm still intertwined with mine whenever she isn’t using it to sip her drink or animatedly share a story—but I haven’t seen that charming smile or that wistful gaze since that song finished. She definitely hasn’t melted back into my embrace again. Which I suppose the more logical part of me would feel relieved about. Whether under the influence or not, it’s not ideal for us to be too close outside of what’s expected of us.","My fictitious partner in this instance has grown significantly less affectionate than she was when they were captivating me on the dance floor. I can barely attribute this change to her upping her dried out measure after taking part in her series of shots. She continues to touch me affectionately, with her arm wrapped around mine while she does not make use of it to raise her drink or expressively educate a tale-- but I have not seen that endearing grin or that dreamy expression since that song finished. She undoubtedly hasn't slipped back into my embrace since then. This is something my rationale would probably be thankful for, drink or no. Friends, in particular, should adhere to social codes of conduct when dealing with one another, and touch, in general, should be practised in dried-up doses.","My companions colleague, who had been quite demonstrative on the dance floor, exhibited a noticeable shift in demeanor afterward. It seemed she was coming down from her rounds of shots, as her interactions with me grew less intense. She was still affectionate, her arm occasionally linked with mine, except when she was busy sipping her drink or animatedly narrating a tale. Yet, the tender smile and far-off gaze that had been so prominent while the music played were now absent. She didn't return to my side with the warmth she had before. From a more practical standpoint, this shift might be considered a good thing. Regardless of her alcohol intake, it's wise for us to maintain a professional distance, keeping our physical closeness within the bounds of propriety rather than letting familiarity go too far.

He walked angrily out the door and down the hallway, and I could hear him exchange brief goodbyes with Tye before the front door shut with a firm thud.","“Fine.” He snatched his phone from the bed where I had left it and tucked it into his pocket. “I surrender. I can’t play this charade with you anymore. It must remain a secret, a casual acquaintance, a one-sided connection – but not too one-sided. I have to be hopelessly enthralled with you, without ever showing any interest in your well-being. Call me when you figure out what the hell you want.” He stormed out of the room and down the corridor, his curt tone slightly gentle when speaking to Tye, before the front door slammed shut with a unmistakable thud.","""Agreed."" He retracted his phone from my bed where it had fallen and shoved it into his pocket. ""I surrender. I cannot engage in this game with you any longer. It must remain confidential, it has to be effortless, it must be unilateral, but not overly so. I need to be infatuated with you while appearing indifferent. Contact me once you clarify your desires.""

I have to be in love with you without showing any concern for you. Call me when you figure out what on earth you want.” He stormed out the door and down the hallway, and I heard him say a quick farewell to Tye, his harsh tone softening with them before the front door shut with a final click.","""Fine,"" He seized his phone and hid it away in his pocket, from where it once lay upon my bed. ""I'm over playing this game with you. It's got to remain a secret, it's got to be casual, it's got to be unrequited but not too unrequited. I'm in love with you without appearing as if I have any affection for you. Call me when you sort out precisely what you desire."" He headed out the door and down the passage, and when I listened in, I heard him wish Tye, "" bye,"" softly. A definitive close of the outside door followed, echoing noisily through the empty hallway, signifying a perceptible coda.","“Alright,” he muttered, retrieving his phone from the bed and tucking it into his pocket. ""I'm done. I can't keep up with your games. It has to be discreet, it has to be effortless, it has to be one-sided yet not excessively so. I'm supposed to pine for you without revealing my feelings. Give me a call when you've made up your mind about what you truly desire."" With that, he brushed past me and exited the room, his steps echoing down the hallway. A softened murmur reached my ears as he bid Tye farewell, and the front door's latch confirmed his departure."

It seemed to come alive and have a mind of its own. Sticks didn't just dangle from his strings but stood firmly with his feet planted, as if he had real weight and substance.

This particular performance felt organic. The puppet, Sticks, paused, shifted his head to one side, lifted his face obscured by darkness, and took in the ambient air. Following this, he ascended from the ground and positioned himself between us on the porch. In a surprising turn, Clark vanished into thin air. I lost sight of Sticks' strings; no longer did he dangle like a traditional marionette barely touching the floor. Instead, Sticks stood firmly on the porch, his balance anchored not in artificial strings but from within his body. Gently, he stroked his face in contemplation with one hand, and seemed to detect an aroma that prompted him to pivot, presenting his blind face towards me.","Most marionettes are fussy and clattery.

The stick-figure character I had crafted hesitated, tilted his head to one side, lifted his sightless mask, and inhaled deeply.

No longer were the strings that tethered Sticks evident; he stood unwaveringly on the wooden planks, his balance now centered not in the puppeteer's strings but in his core.

Rory and Tom reside far enough out in the suburbs that they can afford a roomy backyard with a deck, where they host family barbecues the final Saturday of each month. The weather tonight is perfect: muggy and warm, but breezy enough that it's not a nuisance. Rory is preparing cornbread, and it smells so delicious, I believe this may be the first meal I can keep down this week due to anxiety. They're arguing on the patio when I arrive. The disagreement, I understand, is whether it was fair of HR to rebuke Rory's workstation companion for complimenting a colleague on her beautiful hair that day.","I'm not sure Rory has a Twitter presence. Thankfully, this is advantageous tonight. Rory and Tom are located far in the outskirts of a suburban area, giving them the luxury of a large backyard equipped with a deck. They frequently host family gatherings for barbecues every last Saturday of the month. The climate tonight is ideal: excessively humid with high temperatures, yet the gentle breeze alleviates the discomfort. Rory is preparing cornbread and the aroma is terrific - possibly my initial meal this week that doesn't induce nausea due to anxiety. Upon my arrival, they are arguing on the patio. It appears to stem from whether HR acted ethically by reprimanding Rory's colleague for complimenting her hairstyle, describing it as stunning that day.","I doubt Rory even has a Twitter account.

Rory is preparing cornbread, and it smells so wonderful, I believe this might be the first meal I can keep down this week without feeling nauseous from anxiety.

Rory is preparing cornbread, and the aroma is so captivating, I believe this could be the first meal I manage this week that doesn't provoke nausea due to anxiety.

Rory is preparing corn pone, and it wafts such an inviting aroma, it could potentially be the first meal I endure this week that doesn't return upwards from stress.

Rory and Tom reside in the outskirts of the suburbs, where they have a generously sized backyard with a deck that serves as the venue for their monthly family barbecues on the last Saturday of every month. Tonight's weather is near perfect: slightly muggy yet warm, with a pleasant breeze that keeps it comfortable. Rory is in the kitchen whipping up some delicious corn bread, its aroma so tantalizing that it might just be the meal that settles well in my stomach this week, offering respite from the rollercoaster of anxiety. Upon my arrival, I find them engaged in a lively debate on the patio. It seems the topic of contention is whether HR was justified in admonishing Rory's desk mate for complimenting a colleague on her stunning hair that day."

10807,"I stood gazing at the ugly snowman I had made, feeling rather foolish and wondering if the king in the tree really meant to step inside the snowman and use it as a vessel. Wendell had said that the kings body had decayed, so he needed to use something, but I couldnt really imagine this. Of course, the king was still trapped, so what body he wished to step inside was something of a moot point.","I was staring at the unattractive snowman that I had constructed, feeling quite silly and questioning if the ruler in the tree genuinely intended to enter the snowman and utilize it as a container.

As Wendell explained that the king's physical form had diminished, necessitating the adoption of an alternative vessel, it struck me as improbable. In any case, since the king remained entombed, the specific identity of the entity he desired to inhabit—assuming he did find a new one—had but scant weight in the matter.","I stood staring at the unattractive snowman I had constructed, feeling somewhat foolish and pondering whether the king in the tree genuinely intended to enter the snowman and utilize it as a receptacle.

};","I stood, gazing at the rather odd snowman I had constructed, and I couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed. I pondered whether the mythical king residing in the tree truly intended to inhabit the snow figure as his temporary abode. Wendell had mentioned that the king's physical form had disintegrated, necessitating a new vessel, but the idea seemed almost too surreal to comprehend. Of course, with the king still confined to his arboreal realm, the choice of a new body was almost a hypothetical dilemma."
13532,"Hands wrested the sack away and Kat’s sister at last stepped into view, a masked custodian at her side. The coachman’s coat was gone, her hair an unbraided golden spill across the shoulders of an ice-blue gown. No longer the hard-edged assassin, all angles and threat, she was softer, round-shouldered, her diffident posture at odds with the certainty of her words. All save in the eyes, which, though no longer ringed with black make-up, remained cold and unblinking. Even so, Kat barely recognised her – perhaps wouldn’t have done so without the sudden, persistent itch in her aetherios tattoo. The amashti could cloak herself in finery all she wished, curb her manner to an ingenue’s softness, but some recognition went beyond sight. ","Hands grabbed the sack and Kat's sister finally came into view, a masked caretaker by her side. The coachman's coat was gone, her hair a loose golden spill over the shoulders of an ice-blue dress.

Except in the eyes, which, although no longer ringed with black makeup, stayed cold and staring. Still, Kat barely recognized her - perhaps wouldn't have without the sudden, persistent itch in her aetherios tattoo. The amashti could dress herself in finery as much as she wanted, restrain her manner to a naive softness, but some recognition went beyond sight.","Hands grabbed the sack and Kat's sister finally emerged, a masked caretaker by her side. The driver's jacket was missing, her hair freely flowing in a golden cascade over the shoulders of an ice-blue gown. No longer the sharp-edged killer, all edges and danger, she appeared gentler, with rounded shoulders and a hesitant posture conflicting with the conviction of her statements. Except for her eyes, which, though no longer encircled with dark makeup, remained icy and unflinching. Nevertheless, Kat barely identified her - maybe wouldn't have done so without the abrupt, persistent tingling in her aetherios tattoo. The amashti could dress herself in luxury as much as she wanted, temper her demeanor to that of a naïve innocent, but some recognition transcended physical appearance.","Gripping the sack, the woman emerged, revealing Kat’s sibling gasping into the light, accompanied by a masked guard. The coachman's attire had vanished, and her tumble of golden hair cascaded down the shoulders of her form-fitting ice-blue dress. Unmistakably, she wasn't the precise assassin of before – angular and menacing – she was softer now, slumped-shouldered, her uncertain posture dissonant to the strength of her voice. It was her eyes that betrayed her most, as the black makeup encircling them had dissipated, yet they remained icy and impassive. Yet, even despite Kat's struggle to recognize her, there'd been a sudden, persisting itch in the pulsating pattern of her aetherios tattoo. The amashti might adorn herself in all the elegance she desired, or lower her manner to the gentleness of a loving daughter, but recognition ran deeper than that.","Hands snatched the bag away and Kat's sister finally emerged, accompanied by a masked guardian. The coachman's coat was missing, replaced by an unbraidedcascade of golden hair cascading down the shoulders of an ice-blue gown. No longer the sharp-edged assassin, all harsh lines and menace, she appeared softer, her shoulders rounded, her tentative posture at odds with the confidence of her speech. All except for her eyes, which, although no longer rimmed with black makeup, remained cold and unwavering. Despite these changes, Kat barely recognized her – she might not have acknowledged her at all without the sudden, constant itching of her aetherios tattoo. Whether draped in finery or assuming the appearance of a naive young woman, some sense of recognition transcended physical attributes.","Kat's sister was pulled away from the sack, and at last, she appeared, accompanied by a guard wearing a mask. The coachman's coat was missing, and her hair fell down her shoulders in a golden cascade, adorning a sapphire-colored gown. No longer the sharp-edged assassin, with angular features and an intimidating demeanor, she seemed softer, more rounded, her timid posture contrasting with the confidence of her voice. Only her eyes remained the same, still cold and unwavering, even without the black makeup around them. Despite the change in attire and demeanor, Kat struggled to recognize her, perhaps not recognizing her without the sudden, recurring itch in her aetherios tattoo. The amashti might disguise herself in fine clothes, behave like an innocent girl, but there was a form of recognition that surpassed sight.","Hands wrested the sack away and Kat's sister finally emerged, flanked by a masked guardian. The coachman's coat was gone, her long hair cascading down the icy blue gown like a golden river across her shoulders. No longer the ruthless operative, all sharp edges and menace, she had evolved into a softer, more rounded version, her hesitant posture at odds with the conviction behind her words. All except for the eyes, which, though no longer rimmed with dark eyeliner, still gleamed with an icy intensity. Even so, Kat barely recognized her – perhaps wouldn't have done so without the sudden, gnawing sensation in her aetherios tattoo. The amashti could don the finest attire, school her demeanor to a demure subtlety, but some aspect of her essence remained unchanged.","Hands wrestled the sack free and Kat's sister at last emerged into view, an anonymous guard with her by her side. The coachman's coat had disappeared, her hair cascaded untamed in hues of auburn across the shoulders of a frosty blue gown. The once formidable assassin had transformed, no longer characterized by sharp angles and peril, instead appearing elegiac, with a slight build, her reticent stance seemingly incongruous with the assertive tone of her speech. Except for her eyes, which despite no longer being lined with dark cosmetics, remained aloof and piercing. Kat struggled to recognize her – if not for the sudden, irrepressible tingle in the aetherial markings. The amashti could don attire of grandeur and soften her demeanor to a demure's blush of innocence, yet her essence eluded mere visual perception.","Hands wrested the bag away and Kat’s sister finally stepped into view, a masked guardian at her side.

The coachman's coat was missing, and her hair, once tied back, dangled loose beneath the retrieved gown's collar. Rather than the rugged, implacable killer she had formerly been, her mysterious disappearance had produced a feminine form that was rounder, more full, exhibiting a tentative posture in direct contrast to the tirelessness and self-assuredness of her words. Her eyes, however, remained ebon and unyielding, mysterious despite their lack of their customary black mysterious make-up. Though the amashti could make herself appear any way she desired, her tireless, silent aura was forever tireless and unyielding, and Kat, who had vividly observed her transformed appearance, found herself questioning her own ability to discern the distinctions that made her beloved, even in this altered version of herself. Alas, beneath that retrieved coat, her aetherios tattoo remained, and the agitated itch beneath its delicate lines remained tireless, leaving no place for her mysterious interactions with these incarnations of established identities.""","The sack was abruptly wrenched from the wrestler's grasp, and as it fell, Kat's sister emerged, accompanied by a masked attendant. The coachman's attire had vanished, her untamed hair cascading over the silk shoulders of a dazzling azure gown. Transformed from the sharp, menacing figure of an assassin, her new presence was gentler, with slumped shoulders and a bashful demeanor, contradicting the unwavering assertiveness of her voice. Yet her eyes, previously framed by smoky shadows, shone clear and piercing, unfaltering and as chilling as ever. Despite the changes, Kat wouldn't have instantly recognized her sibling if not for the insistent irritation in the ink of her aetherios sigil, the amashti's fine clothes and tender facade not enough to fully conceal her identity.

Changes made for stylistic improvement and minor tweaks:
- ""wrested"" to ""wrenched"" for a slightly different nuance in how the sack was taken away.
- ""stepped"" to ""emer"

Tell him the truth, Lucy echoed internally. Everything is about to change, she said instead.","Now she stood midway down the hallway, distanced nearly a half-room from the entire family together uncovering the reality of her deceit and preparing to eject her from the premises due to her lack of full admission. Olivia managed to edge further ahead and quietly made her way into the chamber, leaving Simon and Lucy in a secluded state again. Nick likely stayed at the bottom level to afford the family some seclusion. Now presented with an opportunity, she intended to seize it. She grasped Simon's arm and halted his motion. He loosened his grip enough to shift and face her. Innerly, Lucy urged herself to be candid. Yet, she asserted, ""The situation is going to evolve,"" rather than reveal the truth.","Now she was halfway down the hall from the entire family collectively discovering the reality of her deceit and expelling her from the house because she hadn't confessed everything herself. Olivia went ahead of them and entered the room, leaving Simon and Lucy alone once again. Nick must have stayed downstairs to allow the family some privacy. This was her opportunity, and she needed to seize it. Simon, she called and held him back. He loosened his grip just enough to turn and face her. Lucy. Tell him the truth, Lucy reminded herself. Things are about to change, she said instead.","Now she was a quarter of the way down the hall from the whole family as they all learned the truth about her deceptiveness and eviction from the house for her inadequate admission. Olivia was ahead of them, and she slipped into the room, leaving Simon and Lucy by themselves again. Nick should have been downstairs to give them some privacy. Now was her opportunity, and she would have to seize it. Simon, she informed and gave him enough space to turn to face her. Lucy. Please, tell him the truth, Lucy urged herself to do. Things will change, she said instead.""","Olivia now found herself a short distance from the family's mutual discovery of her deception, with the imminent threat of being ejected from the household because she hadn't confessed voluntarily. Slipping into a nearby room, she left Simon and Lucy to their solitude once more, as Nick had thoughtfully descended to afford the family some private moments. This was her pivotal juncture; she had to act decisively. ""Simon,"" she addressed him, halting him in his tracks. He turned to her, a mix of curiosity and concern in his eyes. ""Lucy,"" she corrected herself. It was time for the truth. ""I need to tell you everything,"" she confessed, her voice trembling with honesty."

She spoke before she could stop herself. I hope we get to meet Keegan soon. As do I, Iris. She will love you both, Marisol said, but her voice was suddenly tremulous, as if she were swallowing tears. And Iris realized Keegan must have been gone for quite some time now, if the garden had fallen into this much disarray again.","Marisol and Iris were gardening together and joking around. Iris said she hoped to meet Keegan soon, not realizing Keegan had been gone for a while based on the poor condition of the garden. This made Marisol emotional. ","Not absurd at all.

I can envision it, Iris teased, to which Marisol playfully threw a weed at her. They returned to their tasks, Iris observing the ground soften and crumble beneath her efforts. She spoke before she could hold back. I hope we get to meet Keegan soon. As do I, Iris. She will adore you both, Marisol said, but her voice was suddenly shaky, as if she were holding back tears. And Iris realized Keegan must have been absent for quite a while now, if the garden had deteriorated to this extent once again.","Definitely not foolish. Even so, I struggle to fathom you ever uttering a contentious statement, Marisol. You're as angelic as a saint. Marisol grinned. Alright, believe me then - I have my moments. I can easily see it, Iris jests, prompting Marisol to throw a handful of grass in waggish reproof at her. They resumed their labor, Iris noting the soil yielding and fracturing beneath her exertions. She blurted out before she could censor herself. I truly hope we meet Keegan soon. Me too, Iris echoed. Keegan will adore both of you, Marisol affirmed; her voice, however, suddenly shook, as if she was咽down tears.

And Iris deduced that Keegan must have been gone for a considerable amount of time now, if the garden had become this disordered once again.","Certainly not, Marisol. Although it's hard for me to envision you uttering any harsh words, you truly are remarkable. Marisol chuckled. Absolutely, I can attest to that.

Although, I must confess, I'm quite baffled by the idea of you uttering a harsh word—you're almost like a cherished guardian angel. Marisol chuckled at the thought. Indeed, I do have a fiery spirit at times. I can't say I'm surprised, Iris quipped, and with a mischievous glint in her eye, she playfully aimed a handful of weeds at Marisol, who deftly caught them. They both resumed their gardening, Iris observing how the soil softened and crumbled under her hands. Without intending to, she voiced her thoughts aloud, ""I hope we meet Keegan soon."" A hopeful look crossed Iris's face. ""Oh, I long for that too,"" Marisol replied, her voice tinged with emotion, hinting at a melancholy that arose as she recognized the overgrown garden was a sign Keegan had been away for quite some time."

It's a decision I can understand. Absolutely. His smile is affectionate. Which prompts me to ask, Do you miss her? After a prolonged silence, I don't believe you can miss someone you've never met, but ...","His expression is cautious, as if he's discerning which words to use. Why didn't she return? He sighs. There were...complications. With the principal scientist of her team. Why? They had some...disagreement concerning their collaborative research. He was fiercely domineering. She wouldn't conform. You can imagine the aftermath. His facial expression remains blank. Her journals are...She wasn't well when she discovered she wouldn't be welcomed back. That's disingenuous. How dare he exclude her from her own research team? Jack doesn't reply. His silence feels notably longer than usual. Her work was in semiconductors. My curiosity piques. It's not my expertise, but I have some knowledge about it, as it overlaps with the topic my mentor explores. I wonder if I)viewed Jack's mother's publications years ago without even realizing it. An unseen connection, binding us. High-end research? Absolutely stellar, yes. I assume she was exceptional. I mean, she was a theoretical physicist. Indeed. On the other hand, she did marry my father. Fair point. Could it be that he used to be more...involved with his environment? Possibly. Could it be that she required a green card, or the Smith funds?

His expression is expressionless. Her journals are... She wasn't in a good state when she discovered she wouldn't be allowed back. That's outrageous. How dare he exclude her from her own research team? Jack doesn't react. His pause seems a bit longer than usual. Her work was on semiconductors. My eyes widen in surprise. It's not my area of expertise, but I know a little about it because it's one of the topics my mentor focuses on. I wonder if I read Jack's mom's papers years ago without even realizing it. An invisible connection, linking us together. It's solid, right? I bet she was exceptional. I mean, she was a theoretical physicist. True. On the other hand, she did marry my dad. A valid observation. Maybe he was more... involved with his surroundings back then? Possibly. Maybe she needed a green card? Or the Smith funding. She was a graduate student. It's a decision I can appreciate. Without a doubt. His smile is warm and affectionate. And it has me questioning, Do you miss her? A lengthy pause. I don't think you can miss someone you've never met, but.","His tone is measured, indicative of his thoughtful selection of words. Why hadn't she returned? He sighed. There had been... complications. With the principal researcher of her group. Why? They encountered... conflicts over their collaborative project. He was demanding. She refused to comply. Incidentally, her work centered on semiconductors. The revelation caused my brows to lift. It wasn't my field, but I had some passing knowledge due to its connection to my mentor's work. I ponder whether I'd somehow encountered her mother's research years ago unknowingly. A subliminal thread, tying us together. The quality of her work seemed exceptional, given her standing as a theoretical physicist. Nevertheless, she had married my father. That's an intriguing observation. Perhaps he was once more... involved with his surroundings? Maybe she required a green card? Or perhaps it was the Smith family's support. She was a doctoral student, after all – a career transition I can appreciate. His smile held a sense of nostalgia. Now, I couldn't help but question, Did you feel a connection to her? A significant pause. I don't think you can feel a connection to someone you've never met, he responded.","His tone is cautious, as if choosing his words with deliberation. Why didn't she return?

How dare he exclude her from her own research group? Jack doesn't respond. The silence feels slightly longer than usual. Her work focused on semiconductors. My eyes widen in surprise. It's not my area of expertise, but I've learned a little about it, as it's one of the topics my mentor has explored. I wonder if I've read Jack's mom's papers years ago without realizing it. An invisible bond, connecting us. Good stuff? Very well-grounded, yes. I imagine she was exceptional. I mean, she was a theoretical physicist. Indeed. On the other hand, she did marry my father. Valid point. Perhaps he used to be more... attuned to his surroundings? Possibly. Maybe she required a green card or the Smith family's financial support. She was a graduate student.

I'm not sure you can miss someone you've never met, but...","His voice emits caution, akin to him selecting his phrases deliberately. Why didn't she return? He releases a breath. There were...complications. With the primary investigator of her squad. Reasons? They found themselves at odds regarding their collaborative study. She perceived him as exceedingly dictatorial. Her stance? To stand firm in rejection. Try to fathom the rest. His countenance remains impassive. Perused her journals. She faltered in health upon learning she'd be precluded from rejoining. An absolute injustice. The audacity to exclude her from her own team! Silence from Jack. His halt extends a tad beyond usual. Research on semiconductors. An eyebrow lifts in surprise. While it's not within my wheelhouse, there's at least passing familiarity with the subject, given it's an area my advisor specializes in. Could there be a thread unseen? A subtle connection. Riveting, right? She had aptitude, as evident. Can attest: she was a gifted theoretical physicist. But...isn't it curious that she joined my father? A salient detail. Perhaps he wasn't quite as removed from the world as I thought? Doubtful. It's possible she required a visa? Or the Walton funds. Furthering her studies as a postgrad. A decision that's understandable, if not admirable. Unquestionably. Evidence in his smile, laced with nostalgia. Consequently, I question: do you long for her presence? A notable silence. I don't suppose one yearns for someone they've never encountered.","His tone is cautious, as if he’s selecting his words deliberately. Why didn’t she return? He exhales deeply.

She refused to comply. You can guess the rest. His expression is emotionless. Her journals are . . . She wasn’t doing well when she learned that she wouldn’t be allowed back. That’s nonsense.

Issues arose between her principal investigator and his lead researcher. Why? They had debatable disagreements over their joint research. He is eerily calm. She refused to cooperate. Why? Her records indicate that at the time, she wasn't well. Jack's expression remains blank. Her entries reveal that she was deeply hurt when her group cut her out, depriving her of her research groupos. I can understand her defiance. They had different points of view on semiconductors, which is why my eyes widen, because its a field my mentor works in. What's interesting is that his mom might be connected to us, through an invisible thread. His response is predictable. Although her work was on semiconductors, I mentally wave him off. After all, she was my dad's student, and I believed my mom was great. After all, she was a theoretical physicist. That's a valid point. On the other hand, maybe my dad was less engaged. Maybe he was more interested in the topics that interested him. Was my mom green card-worthy? Or could my dad have used her for the Smith money? Maybe he did then, and maybe she needed it. His smile is fond, as if he's revealing a pivotal yet grudging acknowledgement. And to add, Do you miss her? The question surprises him. His expression remains lovely, but mentally, he's thinking, Do you miss her? Of course not! Because my mom has never been to my house, but.... I digress. I apologize for my lapse of judgment. Jack's silence is extreme. Her notes confirm that at the time, she's been feeling ill. Jack's response surprises me. He seems to believe sometimes you can't miss someone you've never met, but... I wonder if my mom is more connected than I thought. Jack's smile hints at something beyond your comprehension. Good stuff, indeed! Of course, Jack's opines that your mom was magnificent. He's talking about my mom, the theoretical physicist. Do you miss her? A","His demeanor is cautious, as if choosing his words with deliberate care. Why hadn't she returned to the group? He let out a sigh. There were complications, he argued. They stemmed from conflicts with the principal investigator of her team. Why? There was a clash over research direction. The lead researcher had a domineering nature. She boldly stood up to him. The ensuing tale was, as expected, fraught with tension. His expression remained impassive. Her personal journals, now a lifeline to understanding her anguish, revealed her distress upon learning she was barred from resuming her role in the research team. That's outrageous. How could he, the head of her research group, exclude her from her own work? Jack remained silent, the silence hanging in the air longer than usual. Her field was advanced semiconductor research. My eyebrows furrowed in recognition. Although it wasn't my area of expertise, I had encountered this topic in passing, because it was a focus of my mentor's research. A fleeting connection surfaced in my mind. Perhaps I had unknowingly read her papers years ago. A thread of shared destiny wove through our lives. Indeed, the work was impressive, as I'm sure she was—a theoretical physicist. Yes, that made sense. And yet, she had chosen my father, for better or worse. A duality presented itself—a marriage of convenience, perhaps driven by the need for a green card or the allure of the Smith family's wealth. Her ambition as a graduate student was commendable, a move I could understand, even admire. A gentle smile graced his lips, prompting my inquiry, Do you mourn her absence? After a contemplative silence, he replied, I suppose you can't miss someone you've never met, but in a way, yes—we both missed the potential of what could have been between them."

Who indeed, he mused aloud as he retreated, then shifted his Jeep into gear, exited the gravel parking area, and massaged his nape. Initially, he thought the latest murders of the sex workers were straightforward, suspecting his old adversary, Father John, somehow resurrected and was stalking the New Orleans streets again, but increasingly he considered it could be more complicated. More intricate. More malevolent. Something he had yet to uncover. He pondered Kristi and her assault, the killing of her spouse, and the tormenting notes she received, which he was certain Ned Zavala was incapable of composing. But what about his mother? And how did this all intertwine with Father John? He simply could not align the disjointed pieces of this unresolved puzzle, regardless of his efforts. Exasperated, Bentz departed Our Lady of the Grove with more inquiries than answers and only hoped Montoya had encountered more progress.","Absolutely physically capable of overpowering an unsuspecting target. And nevertheless, Anthony Creswell was a genuine man of faith. A believer. Certainly not a killer. At least Bentz presumed as much. There was a line from an old radio show that Bentz had frequently heard his grandfather quote, something about evil residing in mens hearts. He couldn't recall the precise quote but it felt fitting now as he watched the priest vanish from the window. Who indeed, he pondered aloud as he retreated, then placed his Jeep into drive, exited the gravel lot, and massaged the back of his neck. He had initially believed the recent killings of the prostitutes was a clear-cut case, that his old adversary, Father John, had somehow been revived and was haunting the streets of New Orleans again, but increasingly he was beginning to suspect it might be something more. Something more intricate. Something more malevolent. Something he was yet to work out. He contemplated Kristi and the assault against her, the murder of her spouse and the notes left to intimidate her, notes he was certain Ned Zavala was incapable of composing. But what about his mother? And how did this all correlate with Father John? He couldn't compel the pieces of this ill-fitting jigsaw together, no matter how he attempted. Disheartened, Bentz exited Our Lady of the Grove with more questions than he had answers and only hoped Montoya had fared better.","Indisputably possessing the strength to overpower an unsuspecting victim. Nonetheless, Anthony Creswell was an authentic man of faith. A devotee. Absolutely not a killer. At least Bentz presumed as much. A line from an old radio drama frequently echoed in his grandfather's words came to his mind, ""Evil lurks in the hearts of men."" He couldn't recall the exact quote, but it felt fitting as he observed the priest depart from the window. Who knows, he pondered aloud, retreating and starting his Jeep, as he exited the gravel lot, rubbing the back of his neck. Originally, he believed the recent deaths of the prostitutes were straightforward, ascribing the events to the return of his arch-enemy, Father John, wandering the Boulevard of New Orleans once more. However, he was starting to suspect it might be something far more complex, something far more tangled, something more treacherous. Something he hadn't yet figured out. He ruminated about Kristi and the assault she experienced, the murder of her spouse, and the unsettling notes that were left to unsettle her, notes he was certain Ned Zavala couldn't have composed. But what about his mother? And how did everything tie in with Father John? He couldn't fit the fragments of this jigsaw puzzle together, regardless of his efforts. Exasperated, Bentz left Our Lady of the Grove with more questions than answers and only hoped Montoya had been more successful.","Clearly physically formidable against an unsuspecting target. And yet, Anthony Creswell was a devout man of the cloth. A believer. Certainly not a killer. At least Bentz assumed as much. There was a phrase from an old radio show that Bentz's grandfather used to quote, something about evil hiding in the hearts of men. He couldn't recall the exact quote but it seemed fitting now as he watched the priest vanish from view. Who indeed, he thought aloud as he backed away, then shifted his Jeep into gear, pulled out of the gravel lot, and rubbed the back of his neck. Initially, he had thought the recent murders of the sex workers was straightforward, that his old adversary, Father John, had somehow come back to haunt the streets of New Orleans once again, but increasingly he was starting to believe it might be something more. Something more complex. Something more sinister. Something he had yet to unravel. He pondered Kristi and the attack against her, the murder of her husband and the threatening notes left to traumatize her, notes he was certain Ned Zavala was incapable of crafting. But what about his mother? And how did this all tie in with Father John? He couldn't force the pieces of this jarring puzzle together, no matter how hard he tried. Frustrated, Bentz left Our Lady of the Grove with more questions than he had answers and only hoped Montoya had fared better.","Certainly physically capable of overpowering an unsuspecting victim. Nonetheless, Anthony Creswell was a devout man of the cloth, a steadfast believer, and indisputably not a murderer. At least, that's what Bentz presumed. There was a particular quote from a vintage radio program that his grandfather often mentioned, one about malevolence residing in the hearts of men. Unable to recall the precise words, Bentz now found it fitting as he observed the priest vanish from the window. ""Who indeed?"" he murmured to himself, reclining slightly in his chair as he reflected on the situation. Shifting to reverse once more in his Jeep, he then entered the gravel lot and soothed the tension in his neck with a gentle rub. He had initially surmised the recent murders at the heart of the issue, convinced that his long-time adversary, Priest John, had risen from the grave and resumed haunting the streets of New Orleans. Yet, as time passed, he began to suspect that a darker, more complex factor was at play. Something insidiously sinister. Residing in his mind was a puzzle yet to be solved.

The thought brought his attention back to Christie and the brutal encounter she faced, the obliteration of her husband, and the deranged messages meant to instill terror. Messages that Ned Zavala was incapable of conceiving. Then there was the issue of his mother, and the enigmatic link to Father John. He struggled in vain to lock together the crude edges of this fragmented enigma. Consumed by vexation and unable to reconcile the pieces, Bentz departed from Our Lady of the Grove with an abundance of unanswered questions. He could only hope that Montoya had been more fortunate in her endeavors.","Surely physically able to overpower an unsuspecting victim. And yet, Anthony Creswell was a genuine man of the cloth. A believer. Certainly not a killer. At least Bentz thought so. There was a line from an old radio show that Bentz had frequently heard his grandfather quote, something about evil lurking in men's hearts. He couldn't recall the exact phrase, but it felt fitting now as he watched the priest vanish from the window. Who indeed, he pondered aloud as he stepped back, then shifted his Jeep into drive, exited the gravel lot, and rubbed the back of his neck. He had initially believed the recent murders of the prostitutes were straightforward, that his old foe, Father John, had somehow returned and was haunting the streets of New Orleans once more, but increasingly he was starting to think it might be something beyond that. Something more complex. Something more sinister. Something he had yet to unravel. He thought about Kristi and the attack on her, the murder of her husband, and the notes left to terrify her, notes he was convinced Ned Zavala was incapable of writing. But what about his mother? And how did this all connect with Father John? He couldn't force the pieces of this mismatched puzzle together, no matter how hard he tried. Frustrated, Bentz left Our Lady of the Grove with more questions than answers and could only hope Montoya had found more clarity.","Of course, physically capable of overpowering an uninformed victim. And yet, Anthony Creswell was a true man of the cloth. A believer. Certainly not a murderer. At least Bentz assumed as much. There was a dictum from an old radio show that Bentz had often heard his grandfather quote, something about evil lurking in mens hearts. He couldn't recall the exact quote but it seemed appropriate now as he viewed the priest vanish from the window. Who indeed, he thought aloud, as he backed up, then placed his Jeep into drive, pulled out of the gravel lot, and rubbed the back of his neck. He'd initially thought the recent attacks of the kibitzers was clear-cut, that his old nemesis, Father John, had somehow been reanimated, and was haunting the streets of New Orleans once more, but increasingly he was starting to believe it might be something more. Something more intricate. Something more malevolent. Something he had yet to determine. He thought about Kristi and the assault against her, the murder of her husband, and the notes left to terrify her, notes he was confident Ned Zavala was incapable of creating. But what about his mother? And how did this all fit in with Father John? He couldn't force the pieces of this disarrayed puzzle together, no matter how he tried. Frustrate, Bentz left Our Lady of the Grove with more questions than he had answers and only hoped Montero had fared better.","Physically imposing and capable of overpowering an unsuspecting victim, Anthony Creswell was, in appearance, the epitome of a man of faith. A devoted believer, he seemed an unlikely suspect for murder—at least in Detective Bently's view. Recalling an old adage from a radio show his grandfather used to mention, something about the capacity for evil within every heart, Bentz pondered its relevance as he watched the priest walk away from the window. The question hung in the air: Who indeed? With a deep sigh, Bentz stepped back into his jeep, reversed out of the gravel lot, and idly scratched the back of his neck. Initially, Bentz had presumed the string of prostitute murders were the handiwork of his old adversary, Father John, who seemed to have risen from the dead to haunt New Orleans once more. Yet, the complexity and sinister nature of the crimes suggested a different, more intricate narrative was unfolding—one that Bentz was determined to unravel. He brooded over the brutal assault on Kristi, the gruesome murder of her spouse, and the disturbing notes meant to haunt her. Bentz was convinced that the sophistication of these notes was beyond what Ned Zavala, a man of gentler character, could have conceived. But what of Kristi's mother? And could these events be connected to the enigmatic Father John? Bentz's mind reeled, trying to piece together the puzzling evidence, growing increasingly perplexed. With little clarity and even fewer leads, he left Our Lady of the Grove with a sense of unease and a desperate hope that his colleague, Montoya, had made more progress in this bewildering investigation."

The seconds elongated, dwindling ever so slowly. And then, at last, Miss de Vries uttered, ""They're welcome to explore, if it could expedite matters.""","The patriarch of the household, closely linked in blood and legacy like a sturdy merchant and his child. Miss de Vries deftly parried this bold opening, her gaze flashing with a hint of amusement. Undoubtedly. Her well-being takes precedence, I assure you. The royal household employs its own discreet security, as you're no doubt aware. The moment lengthened, an uncomfortable silence slowly building. It was only broken when Miss de Vries finally spoke, Her guests may take their time to inspect their surroundings, if that would prove helpful to their conversation.","The initial kin group on the domain, tied together as strongly in blood and kinship as any relative halted, searching for the precise words craftsman and his offspring. Miss de Vries met this indirect advance with a slender grin. Yes. Her well-being is therefore of utmost significance. We have our own constables stationed at the estate, you may know. The moment stretched, extending longer and longer. Eventually, Miss de Vries remarked, They should be permitted to explore the surroundings if it aids in their understanding.","The initial family in the area, connected as closely in lineage and ties as any, she hesitated, searching for the appropriate words—tradesman and his daughter. Miss de Vries received this unexpected move with a faint smile. Indeed. So her protection is of utmost significance. We have our own officers at the palace, you see. The moment lingered, extending longer and longer. Finally, Miss de Vries responded, They are welcome to explore, if it would assist matters.","The very first family in the country, joined as closely as strings on a instrument, she paused, seeking out the correct phrases. Miss de Vries wrapped this encircling assault with a slender smile. Most certainly, most certainly. Therefore, her security is of utmost value. Our very own policemen remain within the palace, you realize. The silence stretched, longer and longer, until at last, Miss de Vries said, They ought to feel free to search about, should it help in making things greater.","The primary family within the realm, unified by both blood and loyalty, similar to any tightly-knit clan the matriarch pondered, found herself at a loss for the precise words. Meanwhile, the local tradesman and his offspring courageously attempted a strategic flanking maneuver. Miss de Vries received this unexpected overture with a barely perceptible smirk. It was indeed clear that her personal security was of the utmost concern. Rest assured, the palace was safeguarded by our dedicated security personnel. The suspense within the room grew, becoming more palpable by the second. And then, with a graceful break in the tension, Miss de Vries generously offered, """

Maybe I'm destined to become like Mrs. Baker - a woman clothed in black with white hair and pale skin, devoid of all vibrancy. If you never married, why do they call you Mrs. Baker? Because that's the title given to the head housekeeper, my dear, whether she is married or not. It demands respect. Moving along the hallway, I assess my surroundings. Closed double doors directly ahead, an open doorway to my right. I glance through it to see a formal dining room, dimly lit but illuminated by two sets of French doors leading to the terrace. Between them sits an elaborate fireplace so grand that I could fit my car inside. A couple of chandeliers hang above each end of a table lengthy enough to accommodate twenty-four individuals. Hopes End has thirty-six rooms, Mrs. Baker mentions as we approach the sealed double doors at the end of the corridor. You only need to focus on three. Miss Hopes' quarters, your own living quarters, and here. I trail behind Mrs. Baker as she turns right, around the corner and into a kitchen spacious enough to rival a restaurant.","Not the option I'd pick, admittedly, considering my lack of relationship experience - no fiancé, no serious long-term boyfriend. Job constraints don't permit otherwise. Exit while you retain your looks, a former colleague at Gurlain Home Health Aid used to advise, as that's when you're more likely to catch a man. Presently, I ponder if the opportunity has passed me by. Might I already be destined to resemble Mrs. Baker - a woman in black with snow-white hair and ashen skin, devoid of color. But why is Mrs. Baker referred to as Mrs. Baker if she's never been married? Convention bestows that title on the lead housekeeper, she'd say to me, regardless of marital status, instilling a sense of respect. Traversing down the corridor, I take a glance around. Solid double-doors block the way straight ahead, a partly open door beckons on my right. I cautiously inspect it to discover an unlit dining room, illuminated by a pair of French doors connecting to a terrace. Framing the space are grand fireplace provisions ample enough for a small car, alongside two lavish chandeliers at the extremities of a banquet table spacious enough to seat over two dozen individuals. Hopes End comprises thirty-six rooms, Mrs. Baker explains as we approach the immovable double-doors at the end of the corridor. You merely need to manage three: Miss Hope's chambers, your personal quarters, and here. I follow Mrs. Baker's path, veering right, rounding the corner, and into a kitchen expansive enough to function as a restaurant.","Not the choice I would make. Then again, I've never had a fiancé. Or even a boyfriend for any significant period of time. The job doesn't allow it. Leave before you lose your appeal, a fellow Gurlain Home Health Aide once advised me.

If you never got married, why are you called Mrs. Baker? Because that's the title given to the head housekeeper, dear, regardless of marital status. It commands respect. I continue down the hallway, examining my surroundings. The double doors ahead are closed tightly, but to the right, an open doorway reveals a formal dining room, unlit yet brightened by two sets of French doors leading to the terrace. Between them stands an elaborate fireplace large enough for a car to fit inside. Chandeliers hang over each end of a table long enough to seat twenty-four people. Hopes End consists of thirty-six rooms, Mrs. Baker explains as we reach the closed double doors at the corridor's end. Your attention should only be on three: Miss Hope's quarters, your quarters, and this room. I follow Mrs. Baker as she turns right, rounding the corner and entering a kitchen large enough to accommodate a restaurant.","Not the path I'd have chosen. However, I never had a fiancé, or even a significant other for an extended period. The profession doesn't accommodate it. It's best to leave while you're still attractive, a fellow Gurlain Home Health Aide once advised me. Else, you'll struggle to attract a partner. Now I ponder if it's now too late. Perhaps I'm destined to resemble Mrs. Baker's women in black with white hair and pale skin, bereft of all vitality. If you remain unmarried, why are you called Mrs. Baker? Because the title signifies the head housekeeper, regardless of marital status. It commands respect. As we continue down the hallway, I assess my environment. Closed double doors ahead, open door to my right. I peek through it to reveal a formal dining room, dimly lit but brightened by two pairs of French doors illuminating the terrace. Between them is a grand fireplace so large that I could park my car within it. Two chandeliers hang over each end of a table capable of seating numerous people. Hopes End boasts thirty-six rooms, Mrs. Baker mentions as we approach the closed double doors at the end of the corridor. You only need to focus on three, she explains.

Hopes End has thirty-six rooms, Mrs. Baker says as we reach the closed double doors at the end of the corridor. You only need concern yourself with three.

I follow Mrs. Baker as she turns right, around the corner, and into a kitchen large enough for a restaurant.","Not the decision I would have taken. Nevertheless, I've never had an engaged period or a steady relationship for any substantial duration. The vocation does not accommodate it. Secure your relationships while you still have your attractiveness, a colleague at Gurlain Home Health once suggested to me. Otherwise, you may never attract a man. Now I ponder if it's already too late. Perhaps my destiny mirrors that of Mrs. Baker – a dark-haired lady with white hair and ashen complexion, devoid of all vibrancy. If you never became married, why are you addressed as Mrs. Baker? In this case, it's an honorific granted to the Head Housekeeper, dear, whether she's ever wed or not. It's a matter of esteem. Advancing along the corridor, I take in my surroundings. The double doors are bolted shut straight before me, yet a portal to my right unveils a gorgeous dining hall. Although unlit, the space is illuminated by dual French doors that open onto the veranda. Between them stands a grand fireplace so expansive I could stow my automobile within it. A duo of chandeliers swing above each extremity of a table that comfortably seats twenty-four individuals. Hopes End comprises thirty-six rooms in total, Mrs. Baker informs me as we ascend the stairs toward the concealed double doors at the terminus of this passageway. Your attention should only span to three: Miss Hopes' accommodations, your private space, and here. I trail Mrs. Baker as she navigates right, around the bend and into a spacious kitchen apt for a dining establishment.","Not the decision I would have made. Then again, I've never had a fiancé. Or even a boyfriend for any considerable duration of time. The job doesn’t allow it. ""Get out while you’ve still got your looks,"" a fellow Gurlain Home Health Aide once advised me. ""Otherwise, you’ll never catch a man."" Now I wonder if it’s already too late. Maybe I’m doomed to become like Mrs. Baker—a woman in black with white hair and pale skin, stripped of all vibrancy. If you’ve never been married, why are you referred to as Mrs. Baker? Because that’s the title assigned to the head housekeeper, dear, whether she’s married or not. It carries weight. Continuing down the hallway, I survey my surroundings. Double doors securely shut straight ahead, an open entrance to my right. I peek through it to see a formal dining room, dim but brightened by two sets of French doors that lead to the terrace. Between them is an ornate fireplace so large I could park my car inside it. A pair of chandeliers dangle over each end of a table long enough to accommodate two dozen people.

Maybe I'm already destined to become like Mrs. Bakera - a woman in black with white hair and pale skin - with no energy or color. As we talk, I observe my surroundings. To my right, the doorway is immediately open. I look through it to see a bright and well-appointed formal dining room. Doors closed shut straight ahead and open to my left. Exploring the corridor further, I observe my surroundings. To my right, a bright and comfortably appointed bedroom with two different sets of French doors leads to the terrace. Between them stands an ornate fireplace so large it could comfortably hold my car. On each side, chandeliers dangle over the centre of the table. Hopes End has thirty-six bedrooms, Mrs. Baker apologetically tells me as we come to a stop at the final, closed double doors of the corridor. I immediately follow Mrs. Baker around the corner, then into a gleaming cook's kitchen.","I might have made a different choice. Yet, reflection reminds me that I've never been engaged, nor have I had a boyfriend over a meaningful stretch. My profession naturally steers clear of such commitments. A colleague at Gurlain Home Health Aide once advised me bluntly, ""Exit while you're still enchanting. Otherwise, your chances with a suitor will vanish."" I'm left pondering whether I've missed my moment, perhaps condemned to a solitary existence akin to the reclusive Mrs. Bakera, who embodies the archetype of the aging spinster, her figure faded into a monochrome silhouette against the stark whiteness of her hair and the pale translucence of her skin. Should one never wed, the appellation 'Mrs.' preceding one's surname is not a reflections of conjugal ties but a honorific conferred upon the senior housekeeper, whether she has walked down an aisle or not—it carries respect and command.

As we stride down the corridor, the options for progression are clear: the double doors before us remain firmly shut, while a welcoming archway invites us to a grand dining room, currently dark but bathed in an ambiance of light courtesy of the French doors that offer views of the terrace. There, an imposing fireplace looms, so grand that it seems a vehicle of my modest sedan could easily fit within its cavernous embrace. Hanging majestically above a massive table capable of seating two dozen guests, are a pair of elaborate chandeliers.

Grounded within the expansive grounds of Hopes End, Mrs. Baker shares, there are only three rooms you need to attend. The late Ms. Hopes' chamber, your own living quarters, and this space we now approach. Intrigued by the historical weight of this manor, I accompany Mrs. Baker as she veers into a kitchen as vast as any restaurant's, fully equipped to cater to an array of culinary del"

August's self-esteem was visibly manifest in his posture and features, yet she hesitated to peer at him for fear of her own composure slipping. **Let me maneuver some figures and get back to you by Monday**, Savage concluded, extending his hand for another handshake with August; he then exchanged grips with Natalie once more before rejoining his associates at the establishment.","And I'm not just referring to the United States.

There was no mistaking the pride that etched itself across his physique, yet he couldn't afford to meet Savage's gaze or he'd risk becoming unnerved. With a confident nod, Savage promised to adjust the figures and would get back to him by Monday. He extended his hand once more for a firm handshake from August, then exchanged a brief but firm grip with Natalie before returning to his group at the bar."

No way, he remarked, stepping closer for a closer inspection. You're absolutely correct. It was more substantial than I anticipated, Maud said.

15387,"It is morning and it is quiet but the city is alive. Where there are people, there is hope. We must gather the children as well. They start their learning young here, so they do—management will have this thing taught—and today can be no different from usual. As I watch, more people from the shanties are brought out by the hair, pulled by the sure angry fists of banshees I do not know well, and by some I do. Around us, more bodies press in to the sides of the road, and  that feeling I get of being crushed with them, as if there is not enough air in the world and not enough sky and I will sink under a great weight. I close my eyes and breathe in deep, trying to breathe past somehow the smell of old sweat and bad food and sourness. I breathe out. She takes my hand gently and I let myself entwine my fingers with hers, to move my body a little closer, maybe for the last time. I close my eyes again. I allow myself off to stand on a beach. I think of my house, the quiet rooms, the dusty books, the floorboards that have creaked under our weights, the handles worn thin through the use of our hands. The house empty because my mothers have gone to the beach to hold hands on the sand and look across the waves. I let myself walk toward them.","Dawn arrives silently while the metropolis stirs awake. Where humans gather, optimism endures. The children are our future so we must nurture them. Education starts early here, the authorities insist it be so—today cannot deviate from the standard. I observe as more residents are dragged from the shanties by the firm, angry hands of unfamiliar banshees and some I recognize. The crowd around us grows denser, pressing in on all sides, and I feel suffocated among them, as though there is insufficient air in this world and inadequate sky and I will be crushed under an immense burden. I shut my eyes and inhale deeply, trying to breathe despite the stale odor of sweat and spoiled food and acridness. I exhale. She gently grasps my hand and I interlock my fingers with hers, shifting my body a little closer, perhaps for the final time. I close my eyes again. I envision myself on a beach. I think of my home, the quiet rooms, the dusty books, the floorboards that have creaked under our weights, the handles worn thin from our hands. The house is empty because my mothers have gone to the beach to hold hands in the sand and gaze at the waves. I imagine walking toward them.","It is morning and it is calm but the city is vibrant. Where there are individuals, there is optimism. We must gather the children as well. They commence their education at a young age here, so they do—leadership will have this concept taught—and today can be no different from the norm. As I observe, more individuals from the makeshift dwellings are brought out by the hair, pulled by the commanding angry fists of unknown figures, and by some I do. Surrounding us, more bodies press against the sides of the road, and that sensation I get of being overwhelmed with them, as if there is not enough air in the world and not enough sky and I will sink under a heavy burden. I shut my eyes and inhale deeply, attempting to breathe beyond somehow the scent of old perspiration and poor cuisine and bitterness. I exhale. She grasps my hand softly and I allow myself to entwine my fingers with hers, to draw my body a bit closer, perhaps for the final time. I shut my eyes again. I permit myself to envision standing on a beach. I think of my abode, the tranquil chambers, the dusty books, the floorboards that have creaked under our bodies, the handles worn thin through the usage of our hands. The house vacant because my mothers have departed for the beach to stroll hand in hand on the sand and gaze over the waves. I permit myself to advance toward them.","Morning has arrived, and silence envelops the city, yet life thrums within its every nook. Where footprints are left by people, hope blossoms too. We must collect the children as well. They are taught from a young age, just as their guardians will ensure this practice continues without variation — the discipline will instill this wisdom. As I observe, individuals emerge from makeshift shelters, forcefully yanked by the determined, albeit unfamiliar, hands of banshees and those well-known to me. Bodies crowd around the narrow roads, opposing forces press in, exacerbating a suffocating sensation where it feels like the world is not vast enough and the air too constrained. To override this, I draw in a deep breath, fighting through the acrid mix of stale sweat, unpalatable aromas, and sourness. I exhale. She tenderly clasps my hand, and instinctively I tangle our fingers, wanting to step closer, possibly for the final time. My eyes close again, and I envision myself on a beach. I envisage my home, its peaceful spaces, the accumulating dust on books, the creak of floorboards worn by our steps, the handles worn thin from habit. The house is devoid of presence, as my mothers gather to hold hands on the sand and gaze out at the waves. I allow myself to walk toward their embrace.","It is early morning and the air is still, but the city comes alive. Where humans gather, there is hope. We must gather the young ones as well. They begin their learning early here, so they do—authorities will ensure this knowledge is imparted—and today must be no different from any other day. As I observe, more people from the slums are dragged out by their hair, pulled by the vengeful fists of entities unknown to me, and some I recognize. In the vicinity, more bodies press against the sides of the road, and  that feeling of being submerged with them, as if the air is insufficient in the world and the sky is too limited, and I will be buried under a massive weight. I shut my eyes and take a deep breath, attempting to breathe past the smell of stale sweat, poor food, and unpleasantness. I exhale. She gently squeezes my hand, and I allow my fingers to intertwine with hers, drawing my body a little closer, possibly for the last time. I close my eyes once more. I permit myself to imagine standing on a beach. I think of my home, the quiet rooms, the dusty books, the creaking floorboards under our footsteps, the handles worn smooth by our constant use. The house will be empty because my mothers have gone to the beach to hold hands on the sand and gaze across the waves. I give myself the freedom to walk towards them.","As the sun ascends and the city stirs to life, the air crackles with purpose. Amidst the populace, optimism blooms. Inclusion of the youngest citizens is essential. Their intellectual journeys commence at a tender age in this haven, as management desires this knowledge permeate every corner of the institution. Today shall be no exception to the daily rituals. As I observe, the denizens of the shantytown are escorted onto the streets by malevolent spirits I am not overly familiar with and some I know well, their grasp strong and unyielding. The crowd surges forward, encircling us like a tide. The sense of being compressed overwhelms me, as if the atmosphere cannot contain each of our dense existences and the world will crumble beneath the burden. I inhale deeply, trying to breathe through the stagnant odors that permeate the air. I exhale, slowly. She offers me her hand, fragile and tender, and I clasp it eagerly, positioning my body closer to her, our embrace a fleeting moment of solace in the chaos. I close my eyes again, summoning a vision of myself on a seashore. I muse upon my home, the tranquil quarters, the dust-laden books, the worn floorboards that have groaned beneath the weight of our lives. The dwelling now desolate, because my mothers have retreated to the sands to unite and gaze upon the horizon, united in their resolve. I walk toward them.","It's dawn and the city is bathed in a quiet stillness, but it's alive with a quiet energy. Where there are people, there's always hope. We must gather the children, too. They start learning from a young age here, so it's only natural that they'll begin today as well – after all, management will ensure this instruction is provided, and today can be like any ordinary day. As I watch, more individuals from the shantytowns are led out by their loved ones, their faces etched with a mix of fear and determination, guided by those I know and those I don't. The crowd around us swells, pressing in along the sidewalk, and I'm overcome with a sense of being suffocated by their bodies, as if there's not enough air or sky to go around, and I'll be crushed by the weight of it all. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, trying to push past the overwhelming smells of stale sweat, spoiled food, and stagnation. I exhale slowly. She takes my hand gently, and I allow myself to intertwine our fingers, drawing my body closer, possibly for the last time. I close my eyes again, and let myself drift away to a distant memory. I imagine myself standing on a beach, the sound of waves crashing in the distance. I think of my home, the quiet rooms, the dusty tomes, the creaking floorboards that bore the weight of our footsteps, the handles worn smooth by our frequent use. The house is empty because my mothers have gone to the beach to hold hands in the sand and gaze out at the waves. I let myself walk towards them.","It is morning, and the city is serene, yet pulsing with life. Where people congregate, there’s an undercurrent of optimism. We must include the young ones. They commence their education early in these parts—management ensures it’s implemented—and today's routine remains constant. As I observe, inhabitants enclosed in their shanties are coaxed out by forceful hands, some familiar and some unknown. The crowd around us tightens, compressing against the road's edges, invoking a sensation of suffocation—as if there is insufficient air in the world and the sky too narrow, threatening to overwhelm with its immensity. I shut my eyes and draw a deep breath, aiming to inhale beyond the pungent odors of perspiration, spoiled meals, and decay. Exhaling deeply, she takes my hand tenderly, permitting my fingers to interlock with hers, drawing our bodies closer, perhaps for the last time. My eyes close once more. I give myself over to the fantasy of standing on a shore. I envision my home, the tranquil spaces, the antiquated tomes, the groaning floorboards underfoot, the handles smoothed by the generations of our touch. The eerie silence of the uninhabited house, as my mothers saunter along the beach, hands interlocked, gazing out over the surf. I surrender to the daydream of approaching them.","It is morning and it is tranquil, yet the city is bustling. Where there are individuals, there is optimism. We must gather the kids as well. They begin their education early here, so they do—management will ensure this knowledge is imparted—and today cannot be different from the norm. As I observe, more people from the slums are dragged out by their hair, pulled by the strong, furious hands of banshees I am unfamiliar with, and by some I am. Around us, additional bodies press against the sides of the street, and that sensation I feel of being suffocated along with them, as if there is insufficient air in the world and not enough sky, and I will collapse under a tremendous weight. I close my eyes and inhale deeply, attempting to breathe past the scent of stale sweat and spoiled food and bitterness. I exhale. She takes my hand softly, and I allow myself to intertwine my fingers with hers, positioning my body a bit closer, perhaps for the final time. I shut my eyes once more. I permit myself to envision standing on a beach. I think of my home, the silent rooms, the dusty novels, the floorboards that have creaked under our weight, the handles worn smooth from our usage. The house is vacant because my mothers have gone to the beach to hold hands in the sand and gaze across the waves. I let myself walk toward them.","It's morning and it's peaceful, yet the city is vivacious. Where there are people, there's hope. We must gather the kids, too. They start their learning early here, so they do—management will have this taught—and today can't be any different. As I observe, more people from the slums are brought out by the strands of their hair, seized by the unequivocal angry arms of banshees I don't know well, and by some I do. Around us, more bodies press in to the sides of the street, and the sensation I get of being crushed among them, as if there's not enough air in the world and not enough sky, and I will sink under a monumental weight. I close my eyes and breathe in deeply, trying to breathe past somehow the scent of old sweat and corrupt food and the sourness. I breathe out. She takes my hand gently and I allow myself to entwine my fingers with hers, to move my body slightly closer, perhaps for the last time. I close my eyes once again. I allow myself to walk down to the shore. I consider my house, the quiet rooms, the dusty books, the floorboards that have creaked under our weights, the handles worn slender through the use of our hands. The house empty since my mothers have gone to the shore to hold hands on the sand and gaze across the waves. I let myself walk toward them.""","It's morning, and a hush settles over the city, yet it's far from lifeless. The presence of people sparks an undercurrent of resilience. There's an urgency to gather the young ones as well; their education begins early, as tradition dictates, and this day is no exception. Observing the scene, I feel the city's pulse, a rhythm that beats with the promise of endurance. As the day unfolds, the shantytown's inhabitants emerge, coaxed by the insistent, determined tugs of angels I both know and do not. The crowd swells against the narrow road, a collective shiver as we brace against the squeeze, the air heavy, the sky low, a tangible weight pressing us down. I inhale deeply, striving to draw in a breath that transcends the pungent odors of perspiration, spoiled fare, and the sharp tang of angst. I exhale and feel the subtle vibration of her presence as she interlaces her fingers with mine. In a quiet gesture of defiance, I let our hands lead, drawing us a little closer, perhaps in a defiant purchase of space and warmth. Her touch anchors me, and I close my eyes once more, conjuring a vision of a beach—a vast expanse of sand stretching to meet the endless embrace of the sea. I imagine my home, its silent chambers echoing with the shadows of our footsteps, the smooth edges of the wooden floors where our lives have left their mark, the door handles barely holding on to the memories of our daily embrace. In this vision, my home stands empty, a silent sentinel, as my mothers find each other on the beach, their joined hands breaking the wave-whipped barrier between land and sea to reach out to me. I allow myself to walk towards them, towards the refuge of their unity, a beacon of hope amidst the relentless tide of the day.

""I think we're all caught in a bit of a creative drought,"" she says. We lack new concepts and all the fresh ideas we generate just seem to dissipate.""","In some way, if I'm discovered, the embarrassment will undoubtedly be mine to bear. I take another step and the floorboards creak, but they don't stop. I seize the opportunity to dash to my room and firmly shut the door behind me. Great. I need to use the restroom. Chapter Thirteen I'm nervously tapping my foot on Tuesday when, during our catch-up, I ask Kris, ""How was last week's Creative?"" She responds, ""It was all right."" Shoving her hair back with a headband, she continues, ""Actually, it was crap. We're all pretty much in a creative slump, it seems. We can't come up with any fresh ideas, and we keep losing all the new stuff.""","Somehow if I'm found out, the blame will solely be mine. Taking another step, I hear the creak, yet they persist. I seize the moment to dash to my room and slam the door shut. Excellent, I have an urgent need to use the bathroom.

""It was okay,"" she replies, shoving her hair back with a headband. ""Actually, it was abysmal."" What went wrong? ""I believe we're all in a creative slump,"" she states. ""We don't have any original ideas and we keep losing them all.""","Somehow, if I'm found out, the humiliation will be a burden I'll have to carry. I take another step and the floorboards creak, but they don't stop. I seize the chance to dash to my room and slam the door shut behind me. Just great. I really need to use the bathroom. Chapter Thirteen As I nervously drum my foot on the couch on Tuesday, during our casual chat, I ask Kris, How was last week's project? It was okay. She pushes her hair back with a hair tie. To be honest, it was a disaster. What went wrong? I think we're all feeling stuck in a creative rut, she says. We don't have any new ideas and all our recent work keeps getting lost.","Somehow, if I'm uncovered, the humiliation will undoubtedly fall on me. I take another step, and the landing creaks, but they persist. I seize the chance to dash to my bedroom and shut the door behind me. Perfect timing. I need to use the restroom.

She tucks her hair behind her ear with a headband. ""It was terrible,"" she confesses. ""What went wrong?"" I contemplate our collective lack of inspiration, she says. Our latest concepts are stagnant, all the innovative material we've devised seems to slip away.","If I'm found out, the humiliation will certainly be mine to endure. I take another step and the floorboard creaks, but they don’t hold back. I seize the chance to dash to my room and shut the door behind me. Perfect. I need to use the restroom.

It was terrible, actually. What happened? I think we’re all in a bit of a creative slump, she says. We don’t have any new ideas and all the recent concepts we keep losing.","However, if I am noticed, the humiliation will undoubtedly be mine to bear. I take another step, and the landing groans, but they dont stop. I choose to run to my room, and when I arrive, I shut the door behind me. Even better, I need to use the bathroom. Chapter Thirteen There's nothing more I can do now that I have found my door. I am nervously tapping my foot on Tuesday when, during our catch-up, I ask Kris, How was last week's Creative Session? It was all right. She balances the hair behind her with a headband. It was rubbish, actually. What happened? I think we're all in a bit of a creative rut, she replies. We don't have any fresh ideas, and the new stuff we're trying to maintain keeps disappearing.""","Caught in the act, the potential embarrassment would undoubtedly be mine to endure. With a stealthy step, I navigate the creaky landing, the boards groaning beneath me, but no one follows. I seize the moment and make a dash for my room, slipping inside and securing the door behind me. Now, I'm faced with an urgent need to use the bathroom. On a particularly anxious Tuesday, I'm nervously tapping my foot during our catch-up session. Out of the blue, I ask Kris about the previous week's Creative meeting. She pauses, pushing her hair back with a swift headband movement. ""Honestly, it was a disaster,"" she confesses. ""I think we're all experiencing a creative slump. We're running out of fresh ideas, and"

I have at my service a maid with unparalleled skill. Indeed. Your keen understanding of human nature seems impeccable. Lucy, though she could not quite articulate it, felt a pleasant warmth spreading within her.

Occasionally someone in publishing develops a conscience and gives a non-white author an opportunity, and the industry acts like it's the only diverse book ever. I've experienced the other side of this. I've witnessed it happen. I've been present when we select our one ""exotic"" book for the season, when we determine who's educated yet marginalized enough to be marketable. It's disturbing, really. But I guess it's advantageous to be the token minority. If the system is flawed, you may as well exploit the diversity hype to get ahead.  ","You're correct, though.

If the norms are disregarded, you might as well ride the inclusivity elevator all the way to the summit.","You're correct. From time to time, within this field, an individual develops a moral compass and gives an underrepresented creator an opportunity, resulting in a significant surge of support for their work as the sole example of diversity. I've been on the opposite side. I've witnessed this firsthand. I've been in the discussions where we select our single high-profile book of the season, where we decide who is sophisticated, eloquent, and attractive yet diverse enough to maximize our promotional efforts.

I have participated in discussions where we select our annual diverse pick, where we evaluate candidates based on educational background, expressiveness, and overall appeal, but with enough 'edge' to meet our marketing goals.

I've been in the meeting when we select our one standout book of the season, when we determine who is intelligent and poised but sufficiently marginalized to justify our marketing investment.

I've been present in the screening room during our selection of a 'monthly diverse book', judging who is perceived as educated, eloquent, visually appealing, yet marginalized sufficiently to make our marketing allocation viable. It's ill-intentioned, you comprehend. But still, there's some benefit to being the representative token. If one longs to bypass the stereotypes, one might as well ascend the 'diversity escalator' to premium positions.","You're correct, though.

There were no guards on the gate any longer; the sleigh in which I had sat hours before was long gone. Even the winding parallel tracks of the runners had disappeared, leaving a vast field of new-fallen snow, and in that snow I saw the tracks of small bare feet. Dancer’s feet. The tracks disappeared up the hill into the snow, back the way we had come, in great strides; Clara had been running. At the sight of those small footprints, I felt the same rush of mingled power and joy that I imagined a hunter must experience with his quarry finally, firmly in sight. ","Outside, everything was dark and quiet. Past the rows of apple trees, now twisted and smelling of rotten cider, the portcullis was open. The drawbridge beyond was covered in sugary snow, with granules sparkling in the soft pink light from the walls. There were no guards at the gate now; the sleigh I had sat in earlier was long gone. Even the parallel tracks left by the sleigh runners had vanished, leaving a vast expanse of fresh fallen snow. And in that snow I saw the small bare footprints of Dancer. The tracks went up the hill and back the way we had come, in big strides; Clara had been running. Seeing those little footprints, I felt the same thrill of power and joy that a hunter must feel when his prey is finally, firmly within reach.","Outside, the world was dim and quiet. Beyond the rows of apple trees, now contorted and emitting a foul stench of spoiled cider, the portcullis remained open.

Even the meandering twin imprints of the runners had faded, leaving a vast expanse of freshly fallen snow, and within that snow, I noticed the traces of tiny unshod feet. Dancer’s feet. The imprints led up the hill into the snow, retracing the route we had taken, in elongated strides; Clara had been sprinting. Upon seeing those diminutive footprints, I experienced the same surge of combined authority and delight that I envisioned a predator must undergo when finally sighting its prey.","Beyond the confines, the realm lay in darkness and tranquility. Over the line of apple orchards, now stunted and emanating a pungent odor of sour cider, the portcullis was revealed open. The drawbridge further on was encased with a coating of sugared snow, crystals shimmering under the subtle pink radiance from the perimeters. There were no sentries manning the entrance now; the sleigh I had occupied hours prior had vanished into oblivion. Even the intricate interlocking lines of the runners had disappeared, leaving a boundless expanse of freshly fallen snow, and on that snow I perceived the prints of diminutive bare feet. Dancer's feet. The prints led uphill into the snow, retracing our past trajectory, in broad leaps; Clara was running. At sight of those tiny footprints, I felt the same adrenaline-laced thrill matched by an hunter upon successfully spotting his prey, firmly in his sights.","Outside, the world was shrouded in darkness and silence. Beyond the ranks of apple trees, now contorted and emitting a foul odor of rotten cider, the portcullis remained open. The drawbridge in the distance was coated with a layer of sugared snow, which sparkled in the gentle pink luminescence emanating from the walls. There were no longer any guards at the gate; the sled on which I had traveled hours earlier had vanished. Even the imprinted grooves of the sled's runners had dissolved, leaving an expansive expanse of untouched snow—a path marked only by the footprints of tiny, bare feet. Dancer's feet. The tracks vanished up the hill into the snow, retracing our path in long strides; Clara had been running. The sight of those miniature footprints ignited within me the same surge of mixed exhilaration and triumph a hunter might feel when finally, unyieldingly, his prey comes into view.","Outside, the world was shrouded in darkness and hush. Beyond the tangled rows of apple trees stinking of spoiled cider, the portcullis gaped wide open. The drawbridge beyond was blanketed with sugary snow, crystals shimmering under the gentle pink glow from the ramparts. The guards at the gate were nowhere to be found; the sleigh in which I had traveled hours prior was long vanished. Not even the winding curved grooves of the runners were discernible anymore, vanquished by a fresh snowfall, and in that snow, I spotted the traces of small, bare feet. Dancer's tiny footprints. The trail vanished up the hill into the snow, back the way we had come, in giant strides; Clara had been running. Upon witnessing those tiny footprints, I felt the same surge of combined exhilaration and power that I believed a hunter must feel when his prey, at last, was clearly within reach.","Outside, the world was shrouded in darkness and stillness. Beyond the rows of withered apple trees, now tangled and heavy with the scent of fermented apples, the portcullis creaked open. The drawbridge beyond was blanketed with sugar-coated snow, crystals sparkling in the gentle rose-hued light that emanated from the walls. The gate was now unguarded; the sleigh in which I had sat hours earlier had long since vanished. Even the winding parallel tracks of the runners had vanished, leaving a vast expanse of freshly fallen snow, and within that snow I spotted the tracks of small, bare feet. Dancer's feet. The tracks disappeared up the hill into the snow, tracing our earlier path, in long strides; Clara had been fleeing. At the sight of those small footprints, I felt the same surge of combined power and exhilaration that I imagined a hunter must experience when finally, finally, his quarry is within reach.","Beneath the outer realm's cloak of darkness and silence, past the rows of apple trees, which were now twisted and emitted the pungent scent of decaying cider, the portcullis was open. The drawbridge afterward was coated with partially melted snow, shining under the delicate pink radiance emanating from the nearby walls. The absence of guards at the gate had become apparent, with the horse-drawn carriage I had previously traveled in having long departed. Not a trace of the carriage's tracks, marked by the runners, remained, resulting in a vast expanse of fresh snow. Amid this snowy field, I observed the footprints of small bare feet. Dancer’s own footprints. These distinct impressions vanished up the incline into the snow, retracing our path in large leaps; Clara had been hurriedly traversing the distance. Upon sighting those petite prints, I experienced a surge of combined vigor and ecstasy, akin to what a hunter might feel upon finally spotting their prey with clarity and certainty.","Outside, the world was dark and still.

At the glimpse of those tiny footprints, I felt the same surge of mixed power and joy that I imagined a hunter must feel when his prey is finally, clearly in sight.","The outside world was dark and still. Beyond the rows of apple trees, now warped and lit with the repulsive scent of ruined cider, the portcullis hung open.

There were no sentries at the gate any longer; the sleigh in which I had rode hours prior was long gone. Even the winding parallel courses of the carriage's runners had vanished, leaving an expansive expanse of new-fell snow, and in that snow I discovered the tracks of slender, bare feet – Dancer's feet. The footprints vanished up the slope into the snow, back the way we had come, in broad, lively strides; Clara's had been bound for them. When I caught sight of those small footprints, I experienced the same surge of blended enthusiasm and power as a hunter would with his chase finally, securely in sight.""","Beyond the orchard of apple trees, now entwined and exuding the pungent aroma of fermented cider, the portcullis lay ajar. The drawbridge beyond was adorned with a white cocoon of sugared snow, its crystalline specks shimmering under the tender blush of light cast by the ramparts. The guards once stationed at the gate had vanished; the sleigh from which I had departed hours ago was nowhere to be seen, its passage indicated only by the absent echo of its parallel tracks in the snow. In their stead, delicate impressions of small, bare feet emerged from the virgin white expanse—traces that cald to Dancer, the reindeer. These tracks wound their way up the incline, paralleling our retreat, each step a testament to Clara's swift pace. Gazing upon those delicate footprints, I was swept up in a surge of exhilaration, akin to the thrill a hunter might feel upon sighting their prey, clear and unmissable.

As she walked back down the hall, she felt frustrated with Peter, with both of them, really, for behaving as if she had done something wrong by immersing herself in her work, as Peter often did. She measured out a dose of cold medicine and brought Ella a glass of juice. When Ella’s fever spiked again, she took her to the doctor’s office for a strep test. The test came back positive, so she rushed to the pharmacy for antibiotics after dropping Louise off at soccer practice.

The outcome turned out fine, don't you think? Returning to the hall, she was grumpy with Peter, as well as both of them, specifically for acting as if she had done something improper by becoming absorbed in her work, as Peter usually did. She measured out a capful of over-the-counter cold medicine and brought Ella a glass of orange juice. When Ella's fever rose again, she brought her to the doctor's office for a strep test.

And yet, everything turned out alright, didn't it? As she retraced her steps back down the hallway, she felt a growing irritation towards Peter, and a broader sense of frustration with both of them for their reaction to her engrossment in her work—a trait she knew all too well Peter possessed. She carefully measured out a capful of cold medicine and offered Ella a glass of orange juice. When Ella's fever spiked again, Maud hurried to the doctor's office for a strep test. The test came back positive, prompting her to dash to the pharmacy for a prescription of antibiotics before dashing off to drop Louise at her soccer practice. While waiting in line for the pink medication, Maud's thoughts drifted to Juana Briones, who had lost three of her children within the same month, each to preventable illnesses—illnesses that Ella and Louise had been vaccinated against, a modern safeguard that Maud was grateful for.

Purely a matter of survival. Do you think I wish I was in your little hamlet? But a man needs a companion in life, and I refuse to find one in the countryside.

Is the following sentence factually correct?

Options:
- yes
- no

yes","One solitary sugar farm might seem trivial when considering the impressive feats achieved on a weekly basis by Calloway, as Simon well knew. Simons eyes widened with intrigue. The deal hadn't even been formally closed, yet here Calloway was, already in the know. How was that possible? One couldn't help but through the Ton without picking up a thing or two. As it unsettlingly apparent that news of Calloway selling the farm had already permeated London's social circles weeks prior, Simon's focus shifted to the casual manner in which his friend discussed high society. Indeed, Forester, though a paragon of gentlemanly conduct, resided in an estate that was less a home and more a mere address. This led him to either frequent London's grandeur or hop between the estates of friends. Unlike Simon, who would have been lost without his sanctuary by the pond, Forester seemed undisturbed by his lack of a fixed abode. Simon couldn't fathom how Forester managed to endure the constant buzz of Society, but Forester merely replied, ""Out of necessity, my friend, out of necessity."" A hint of longing crept into his voice. ""And to be frank, I do. After observing your contented seclusion here, I can't help but admit it."" Yet, he added with a sly grin, a partner was what he truly sought, and not one to be found in the rural depths. How was it that the esteemed and socially adored Nicholas Forester remained a bachelor? Simon pondered. It was a mystery that seemed all the more perplexing when compared to his own fortunate marital status. Simon couldn't help but wonder if Forester didn't envy his own peaceful retreat just as much."

Apple slices and peanut butter nearly every day, the same snack that she served Toni, the same snack she provided us on all those visits after our mother passed away. No pre-packaged treats, no homemade cookies, nothing that could spoil our dinner from Aunt Em, no ma'am. Nonetheless, there was something comforting about the regimen. About knowing what to expect. About observing her hurrying around the kitchen preparing dinner while I recuperated from whatever had transpired at school that day.","A reminiscence came to mind—Aunt Em, seating me before the kitchen table in the farmhouse prior to sending me outside to attend to my tasks.

No pre-packaged sweets, no handmade cookies, nothing that might spoil our evening meal, not from Aunt Em, no, ma'am. Yet, there was a sense of security in the rituals. In familiarity. In witnessing her diligently prepping dinner while I recouped from the day's school happenings.","A sudden recollection flooded my mind—Aunt Em, gently ushering me to the farmhouse table before dismissing me to begin my tasks.

No packaged snacks, no freshly baked cookies, nothing that could sully our evening meal from Aunt Em, no, ma'am. Still, there was something comforting about the familiarity.

Apple segments and peanut spread almost daily, the identical snack she provided for Toni, and the snack she offered on all those trips before our mother's passing.

In realizing what awaited. In observing her diligently navigate the kitchen preparing dinner while I recuperated from whatever incident occurred at school that day.","I had a sudden recollection—Aunt Em, sitting me down at the farmhouse table before she shooed me outside to begin my chores.

Large apple slices and peanut butter nearly every day, the same refreshment she fed Toni, the very same refreshment she provided us on all those visits prior to our mom's dying. No packaged desserts, no homemade biscuits, absolutely nothing that might tarnish our supper from Aunt Em, no, madam. Nonetheless, there was something comforting about the adherence. Associated with understanding what you're receiving. Associated with knowing what you're going to obtain. About witnessing her mingle within the kitchen as I recovered from whatever had occurred at school that day.`**`","I experienced a vivid recollection—Aunt Em, the picture of patience, guiding me to the farmhouse table before nudging me out to complete my daily tasks. She consistently offered us apple slices with a generous spread of peanut butter, the very same nourishment she had given Toni, and what she served us during countless visits following the loss of our mother. Store-bought sweets or freshly baked cookies were nowhere to be found; instead, we enjoyed her simple yet wholesome fare, never allowing indulgences to spoil our evening meal. And yet, there was a comforting familiarity in the predictability of her rituals. In the certainty of what to expect. In observing her deft movements in the kitchen, preparing dinner as I rested after the day's academic trials."

My guess is the Codys didn't know anything about the uranium until yesterday, just like everyone else on the reservation. They were probably asked to help hide the death.

Change 'of' to 'from' in the following phrase:","“Possibly,” James admitted. “It does seem like an enormous task for the Codys to undertake within such a short time frame. Initially, they were tasked to locate the individual and subsequently to eliminate them. And what's driving the Codys' involvement in this mess? Certainly, they have a significant stake in the well-being of the land, given their flock of sheep and their dependence on the local water resources. It's likely they were as unaware of the uranium discovery until recently as the rest of the reservation. They were coerced into aiding in the cover-up of the death, or at best, into diverting attention away from my investigation. Their knowledge was restricted to what was necessary, and they most certainly weren't privy to the fact that United Uranium was contaminating their land.”

13606,"I’m pretty sure I’ve never been this close to Noah. At least not for this long a time. I can sense a sharp tinge of suppressants rolling off him, which I find odd; most male shifters choose to forgo them, too hung up on their ego to miss out on clouding a room with their scent in the hopes that a female shifter will come running. Maybe it’s a professional decision? His scent might not be pleasant. Although, I think I can discredit that theory, given that, strangely, I can faintly make it out even under the chemical tang of his suppressants, making me think he needs a stronger dose. Not that I’m complaining, since I think it might be a nice scent. It’s woodsy. Like pine needles and crisp air. It reminds me of running in the snow on all fours. ","I've never been this physically close to Noah for such a long period of time. I can detect a sharp smell of suppressants coming from him, which is odd since most male shifters opt not to use them because they want females to notice their scent. Perhaps it's a professional choice? Though I doubt that's the reason, because I can still vaguely smell his natural scent beneath the chemicals - it's woodsy, like pine and fresh air, reminding me of running through the snow in my animal form. He may need a stronger dose of suppressants. Still, I don't mind, as his underlying scent seems pleasant.","I’m pretty certain I’ve never been this near Noah. At least not for this extended period. I can detect a strong hint of inhibitors emanating from him, which I find peculiar; most male shifters opt to forgo them, too preoccupied with their pride to miss the opportunity to mask a room with their scent in the hopes that a female shifter will appear. Maybe it’s a strategic choice? His scent may not be appealing. However, I believe I can debunk that assumption, as oddly, I can faintly perceive it even beneath the chemical tang of his inhibitors, leading me to believe he requires a more potent dosage. Not that I’m protesting, as I believe it could be a pleasant scent. It’s outdoorsy. Like evergreen needles and fresh breeze. It evokes memories of sprinting in the snow on all fours.","I'm quite certain this is the closest I've ever been to Noah, at the very least for such an extended period of time.

Perhaps it's a professional choice? His smell might not be particularly pleasant. However, I believe I can rule out this notion, considering, paradoxically, I can faintly detect it even beneath the chemical essence of his inhibitors, suggesting that he requires a higher dosage. But, I should point out, I'm not complaining, as I think it might be an appealing scent. It's reminiscent of forest.

Nonetheless, I suspect that theory is improbable, given that even beneath the chemical essence of his suppressants, I can subtly discern it, leading me to believe he requires a more potent dose.

Although, I believe I can rule that out, given that, paradoxically, I can faintly discern it even beneath the dominant scent of his suppressants, leading me to speculate he needs a more potent dose.

However, I think I can dismiss that idea, considering that, oddly, I can faintly pick it out even beneath the chemical undertone of his suppressants, leading me to believe he needs a stronger dose. Not that I’m objecting, as I actually think it might be a pleasant aroma. It’s earthy. Like pine needles and fresh air. It brings back memories of sprinting in the snow on all fours.","I'm quite confident I've never been this near to Noah. At least not for this prolonged a time. I can feeling a great burst of suppressants cascading off him, which I find peculiar; most male shifters forgo them, also, too enamored with their ego to miss out on tainting a space together with their scent in the hope that a female shifter will come operating. Maybe it's an expert decision? His odor might not be delightful. Although, I think I can challenge that theory, given that, strangely, I can faintly pick it out even beneath the chemical tang of his suppressants, causing me to think he needs a stronger dose. Not that I'm complaining, since I believe it might be a pleasant scent. It's woodsy - similar to pine needles and crisp air. It reminds me of running in snow on all fours.","I'm almost certain I've never stood this close to Noah for an extended period before. I detect a subtle undercurrent of cologne emanating from him, which strikes me as peculiar; most male shifters tend to shun such masks, too prideful to disguise their natural scents in hopes of attracting a fellow shifter's attention. Perhaps it's a calculated choice for professionalism? His innate scent might not be to everyone's liking. However, I can faintly identify it even beneath the synthetic barrier of his cologne, suggesting that he might indeed benefit from a stronger formula. Remarkably, I find it quite pleasing; it's reminiscent of a forest scent, like the fresh needles of pine and the invigorating scent of the air after a snowfall. It evokes memories of running freely through the snow with a sense of wild freedom."

Im going to need that drink. tnba went to the mini fridge that sat next to his desk. He took his time fishing out a bottle of beer. He wasnt surprised that Coker had come to him. Everyone talked about how much money tnbas father had in his lifetime, but few considered how diminished the assets were once they were split thirty-something ways. Not that tnba was destitute. He had inherited enough cash to last him decades of no work, and on top of that, he had worked hard.","Professor Coker moved closer as he spoke. He told tnba to say his middle name too, since it was also his dad's name. People still pray using his father's name, Coker added, so they might also have that kind of money. Coker said he was going to need that drink. tnba went to the mini fridge next to his desk. He leisurely took out a beer bottle. tnba wasn't shocked that Coker had come to see him. Everyone talked about how much money tnba's father had when alive, but few thought about how little was left once split between his many children. Still, tnba wasn't poor. He had inherited sufficient funds to not work for decades, plus he had worked diligently.  ","Professor Coker leaned in closer. Include your middle name, as it was also your father's name. People still pray using his name, you know, in hopes of obtaining wealth. I'll need a drink soon. tnba walked over to the mini fridge by his desk. He carefully selected a bottle of beer. It wasn't unexpected that Coker had sought him out. Everyone discussed the immense fortune tnba's father had amassed, but few considered how much the assets had diminished after being divided among over thirty individuals. Not that tnba was penniless. He had inherited a substantial amount of money that could sustain him for decades without working, in addition to the hard work he had put in himself.","Professor Coker advanced his position. Incorporate your middle name, as it was identical to your father's. Many still invoke his name to receive blessings of prosperity. I'll require that drink. tnba proceeded to a mini fridge positioned near his desk. He spent leisurely reaching for a bottle of beer. He was unsurprised by Coker's visit. Discussions of tnba's father's wealth often highlighted his lifetime earnings, neglecting to account for the substantial reduction resulting from division among the multitude of heirs. Not to imply tnba is impoverished. He possesses an ample inheritance sufficient to sustain him for many years of leisure, augmented by diligent endeavors of his own.","Professor Coker leaned forward.

I'm going to need a drink. tnba went to the mini fridge sitting next to his desk. He took his time retrieving a bottle of beer. He wasn't surprised that Coker had approached him. Everyone discussed how much money tnba's father had accumulated over his lifetime, but few took into account how the assets were distributed among thirty-some people. This didn't mean that tnba was destitute. He had inherited enough capital to last him for decades without working, and on top of that, he had been diligent in his efforts.","Professor Coker leaned closer, emphasizing the need for inclusion of his middle name, sharing that it was also his father's name. He mentioned how prayers continued with his father's name to garner similar financial blessings. A drink was on the horizon, as he headed to the mini fridge adjacent to his desk, taking a moment to locate a bottle of beer. Unsurprised by Coker's visit, he knew the town's talk revolved around his father's wealth during his lifetime, yet failed to recognize the division of assets, shared among thirty-odd relatives. Although tnba wasn't left penniless, he had inherited an adequate sum to sustain years of idleness, coupled with diligent effort.","Here is the rewritten text:

I'm going to need that drink. TRAINING OFCORUS opened the mini fridge beside his desk. He took his time retrieving a bottle of beer. He wasn't shocked that Coker had sought him out. Everyone discussed the vast wealth his father accumulated during his lifetime, but few thought about how those assets were relegated to mere measurables once divided amongst his thirty-something relatives. Not that TRAINING OFCORUS was impoverished. He had inherited sufficient funds to last him decades of financial security, on top of which he had worked diligently.","Professor Coker leaned forward. Incorporate your middle name, as it's also your father's name. People still reverently mention his name during prayers, aiming to mirror his affluence. I'm going to need that drink. TNBA headed over to the compact refrigerator placed beside his desk. He deliberately retrieved a beer bottle. It wasn't startling that Professor Coker sought him out. There was always chatter about TNBA's father's considerable wealth during his lifetime, but less talk about the significant distribution of his assets into thirty-odd parts. Fortunately, TNBA wasn't broke. He had inherited an ample sum to support him for numerous years without labor, and in addition, he had diligently worked.","Professor Coker leaned in. Include your middle name, as that was also your father's name. People still invoke his name, you know, hoping to gain that kind of wealth. I’m going to need that drink.

Add your middle name, since that was also your fathers name. Folks still pray with that name, you understand, so they can have that kind of money. I'm going to require that brew. tnba went to the mini-fridge that sat adjacent to his work area. He took his time searching out a container of ale. He wasn't amazed that Coker had arrived to him. Everyone spoke regarding how much cash tnbas father had at his fingertips when he was alive, but few thought about how diminished the possessions were once they were divided thirty-something ways.

""When you write your full name, be sure to include your father's middle name as well. It's a name still revered, one that people invoke for prosperity and success.

Without a moment's hesitation, tnba moved to the mini fridge nestled beside the professor's desk, retrieving a chilled bottle of craft beer. He wasn't at all surprised by Coker's visit; it was well-known that tnba's father had amassed a substantial fortune during his lifetime. Yet, the inheritance had been significantly divided among the heirs, a fact that Coker was subtly alluding to. Still, tnba wasn't pinning his hopes on the inheritance alone; he had built up a solid foundation of his own through diligent work."

She never won, captivated by Jaîna's expressionless condescension or alternatively looted by Yali's skilled card cheating. As for Rîma, she barely crossed paths.

These brief periods she seized, defying gravity, sprawled atop the mainmast's vantage point – a position she attained without ropes or rigging, simply by strolling across the air.","Spending her hours with little to do – still tangled in the turmoil of events at Osios, she was no more willing to aid the Chainbreaker's crew than they were to accept an inexperienced woman disrupting their routines – Kat spent her time either gazing at the plains as they whirred by from the relative seclusion of the bow, or playing hands of pentassa with Jaîna and Yali. She consistently lost, entranced by Jaîna's straight-faced bluffs or else outright deceived by Yali's skillful card-sharping. Of Rîma, she caught a glimpse of almost nothing.

Her interactions with Rîma were minimal, as Zephyr was generally stationed at the helm except for brief moments of rest, which she took, defying gravity, supine on the watch platform atop the mainmast, a feat achieved sans rigging or ropes by gracefully dancing in mid-air.","With nothing much to occupy her – still reeling from the turbulent aftermath of events at Osios, she was no more eager to assist the Chainbreaker's crew than they were to have an inexperienced woman disrupt their workflows – Kat spent the hours either gazing at the landscape blur by from the relative solitude of the bow, or playing rounds of pentassa with Jaîna and Yali. She lost every game, lured by Jaîna's poker-faced bluffs or else cunningly cheated by Yali's nimble card-tricks. Of Rîma, she caught glimpses only here and there. Zephyr rarely left the helm, handing control to Vallant for brief moments of rest – which he took, regardless of gravity, stretched out along the watch platform atop the mainmast – a feat he achieved effortlessly, simply by walking along the air as if on tiptoes.","Throughout her seemingly endless hours of solitude — still preoccupied with unresolved issues stemming from events at Osios, she held little desire to assist the 'Chainbreaker's' crew, which similarly did not welcome the distraction of an inexperienced woman potentially disrupting their orders — Kat spent her time either gazing out at the sweeping plains from the seclusion of the ship's prow, or engaging in rounds of pentassa with Jaîna and Yali. She consistently lost, either deceived by Jaîna's unyielding bluffs or cheated outright by Yali's adept sleight-of-hand with the cards. Rîma was hardly visible. Zephyr was almost always at his command, only relinquishing the helm to Vallant briefly during moments of rest.

A significant portion of his triumphs stemmed from his grandmother[*], who had vowed to shield him from the titans and other nefarious fey in return for her living at his dwelling during the lunar phase of waning. The fisherman regarded this as a favorable pact, since he was obliged to journey to the marketplace every month for the purpose of bartering his harvest. The fisherman's route to the town passed through a woodland populated by numerous Sylvan Folk, who never bothered him.

The whaler's path to town flowed through an dense forest where the Folk had no stakes in him. Every so often, however, when the whaler was almost at his destination, he entered, and the path that solidified his home in the new moon opened up before him.

The wolf gave a howl, and then more wolves appeared in succession, all larger than the last. Terrified, the whaler rode on his horse back home.

The ancient faerie tree, a mystical sentinel shrouded in enigma, still stands—its path visible at times, enigmatically disappearing at others, and perhaps forever eluding the grasp of the mortal realm.

In a secluded cove, a seasoned whaler forged a solitary existence. His prowess in the sea was partly attributed to his unique pact with a guardian spirit, a mischievous Faerie intent on safeguarding him from malevolent entities and other perilous spirits while he vacated his abode during the moon's new phase. This arrangement proved mutually beneficial, aligning perfectly with the whaler's monthly visits to market to peddle his maritime bounty. His route to town, winding through a forest known to be home to various supernatural beings, was curiously free of any mischief or malice.

Yet, on a fateful journey, as the whaler approached the forest's midway point, he encountered an eerie sight: a massive white wolf, unlike any he had witnessed, barring his path with a commanding presence. The beast let out a chilling howl, and momentarily, a horde of similarly imposing wolves emerged, their eyes gleaming with an unsettling intelligence. Paralyzed by fear, the whaler scrambled onto his horse and fled, leaving behind the spirit of his agreement as a group of fjolskylda sat down to their evening meal, unaware of his imminent return."

""I know he can be obnoxious, but maybe you could be a bit more flexible."" Peter responded, ""Ease up? The sheer absurdity of this inquiry is infuriating. However, if you exert too much pressure, he might completely exclude us.""","Perhaps he's getting complacent. Can we hold off for a moment? inquired Marion. Given her break from Radio City, she had no concerns about the clock. Whatever works for you. Post his departure, Marion directed her attention towards Peter. I understand he's a nuisance, but consider moderating your approach slightly. Moderate? The sheer absurdity of this probe is exasperating. However, if we aggravate him excessively, he might shut us out entirely.","Maybe she's getting restless. Do you mind if we delay? asked Marion. Since it was her week off from the entertainment production, she didn't have to rush through the schedule. Whatever you're comfortable with. After he departed, Marion turned to Peter.

But if you prod too hard, he might disinvolve us entirely.","Perhaps he's becoming a bit complacent. May we hang on a moment, if you don't mind? Marion queried. Considering it was her week off from Radio City, time wouldn't be an issue for her. Whatever you prefer. Afterwards, Marion addressed Peter.

Thats why the hammer came down so hard on Liz Cheneyto send a message of fear. No one wants to be targeted the way shes been targeted, which makes this period we are in perhaps the most dangerous. Observing what has happened to the party of Lincoln, we can make one conclusion with confidence: weve only seen the beginning of Trumpism.","He remarked that for a party so worried about being canceled by the Left, they are quite adept at canceling their own. That is why Liz Cheney was punished so severely - to instill fear. No one desires to be attacked in the manner she has been, which makes this time we live in potentially the most perilous. Looking at what has become of Lincoln's party, we can confidently conclude one thing: we have only witnessed the start of Trumpism.","For a party that is highly concerned about the Left canceling them, they do a pretty decent job of canceling their own, he remarked. That explains why the punishment was severe for Liz Cheney, to instill a sense of fear. Nobody desires to face the same level of hostility that she has encountered, highlighting the current precarious situation. Analyzing the transformation of the party of Lincoln, we can confidently assert that we have merely witnessed the commencement of Trumpism.","Regarding a party that is extremely sensitive to the left disowning them, they manage quite aptly to disown their own members, he remarked. That's why the reprimand was enacted so decisively against Liz Cheney, to instill an aura of fear. Nobody wishes to endure the same level of targeting as she has, making this era perhaps the most perilous. Witnessing the outcomes on the party of Lincoln, we can draw a single conclusion with certainty: we are only experiencing Trumpism's initial stages.","For a party that's extremely cautious about the Left canceling them, they do a fairly good job of canceling themselves, he added. That's why the hammer fell so heavily on Liz Cheney to convey a message of fear. Nobody wants to be targeted in the manner she has been, making this era we are in perhaps the most hazardous. By observing the incidents that have occurred within the party of Lincoln, we can arrive at one conclusion with certainty: we have only witnessed the commencement of Trumpism.","For a party that is remarkably sensitive about the Left cancelling them, they exhibit a seemingly capable ability to cancel their own members. Hence, the harsh response towards Liz Cheney was aimed to instill fear. The current climate might be considered the most perilous, due to the potential repercussions, which makes it understandable why no one wishes to end up in a similar situation to Cheney. Reflecting upon the party of Lincoln, it is evident that we have only witnessed the fledgling stages of Trumpism.","For a party that's extremely sensitive about being perceived as vulnerable to the Left's condemnation, they surprisingly do a decent job of self-destructing, he noted. That's why the hammer came down so hard on Liz Cheney to instill a sense of dread. No one wants to be held up as an example of what happens when you're unfairly targeted, which makes this period we're in perhaps the most perilous. Through observing what has befallen the party of Lincoln, we can conclude with certainty: we've merely scratched the surface of Trumpism's devastating impact.","For a party that prides itself on defending the Left against cancellation, they effectively cancellate their own, he remarked. It's due to this paradox that the repercussions against Liz Cheney were so severe to issue a warning of intimidation. No one desires to be singled out as Cheney has, which suggests that this time could be the most perilous. Reflecting on what has transpired within the party initially led by Lincoln, we can assert with certainty: the inception of Trumpism is only just the start.","For a group that's very concerned about the Left silencing them, they do a remarkable job of silencing their own, he remarked. That's why the punishment was so severe for Liz Cheney—to convey a message of intimidation. No one wants to be singled out like she has been, which makes this time we are in potentially the most perilous. Reflecting on what has transpired with the party of Lincoln, we can confidently conclude: we have only witnessed the onset of Trumpism.","For a party that's very precious about the Left canceling them, they do a very good job of canceling their own, he remarked. That's why the hammer came down so hard against Liz Cheneyto transmit a message of fear. Nobody wants to be targeted the way she's been targeted, making this period all of us now perhaps the most harmful. Looking at what's happened to the party of Lincoln, we could arrive at one conclusion with great confidence: we've just seen the beginning of Trumpism.""}}","Given that the party prides itself on vehemently opposing left-wing cancellations, it ironically excels at self-censorship, a point he emphasized. This explains the severe repercussions faced by Liz Cheney, as the party sought to deter similar fates. The pervasive fear of being ostracized as she has been is palpable, casting a grim light on the current era. As we witness the party of Lincoln navigating these tumultuous times, a singular, resolute conclusion emerges with clarity: Trumpism's influence is just unfolding."

The gathering itself was rather dull - the place reeked of feline excrement - but this gentleman, Yahav, caught my notice by heaping such quantities of food onto his plate that I inspected his build to deduce if he was pure muscle or just thin. As our relationship progressed I'd learn he was both: the moment we were intimate I traced his ribs and firm thighs. But at the party I simply commented on his mountainous plate and requested he report back on what tasted best, an assignment he took most solemnly, even flagging the superior brownies. When circumstances allowed, this was someone who would message me just to bid good morning. He too was divorced, so we related on many fronts - rapid discussions, politics, tapas. I don't buy into predestined partners, but we were well-matched. So in the aftermath of our split, he dominated my thoughts.   ","It would be strange if you did.

Yahav had heaped his plate with so much food that I found myself assessing his physique to determine if he was primarily muscular or just thin-framed. The actual answer was both, as I discovered two years later when we finally became intimate, as I traced my fingers down his ribs and his long, lean quadriceps.

When we were involved, he was similarly divorced and embarking on the divorce proceedings. We were both already acquaintances faculty members at UCLA, both engrossed in rapid-fire discourse, politics, and tapas restaurants. I don't subscribe to the doctrine of soul mates, and that has simplified matters; we were simply harmonious. I had encountered him at a potluck hosted by a psychology mentor's friend, in a dwelling replete with spider plantsan unusually unappealing gathering owing solely to its aromatic cat litter. Yahav had loaded his plate so overflowing with food that I found myself assessing his physique, wondering if he was all brawn or just naturally lean. The answer proved to be both when we eventually slept together, two years hence, as I traced my hand across his ribcage and his elongated, muscular thigh. But at that instant, I had immediately offered contrition for scrutinizing his plate, the mountains of orzo, chicken, and veggie lasagna. I asked, You possess everything in the world, so tell me, what was the most delightful dish? He took the query seriously and proceeded to furnish updates throughout the evening, recommending that the brownies at the table's outer end were the superior ones.","It would be unusual if you did.

When we got together, he was still separated and going through the divorce process. We had already formed a strong connection – both as colleagues teaching at UCLA, enjoying fast-paced conversations, politics, and tapas bars. I don't believe in soul mates, and that's made life easier; we simply worked well together. I met him at a potluck dinner hosted by a psychology professor friend, surrounded by spider plants – a surprisingly unromantic setting, given the lingering scent of cat litter. Yahav had piled his plate with an impressive amount of food, and I found myself scrutinizing his physique to determine whether he was all muscle or lean and wiry. The answer turned out to be both, which I confirmed two years later when we finally slept together – when I ran my hand along his ribcage and impressive quadriceps. But at the time, I apologized for staring at his plate, the towering orzo, chicken, and veggie lasagna. I asked him, since he had everything, what he considered the standout dish to be. He took my request seriously, regularly reporting back throughout the evening, recommending the brownies at the far end of the table as the superior option.","It would be surprising if you did. However, he was an integral part of my story, and he significantly impacted my mental state during those two weeks. To avoid sounding naive and needy: This person I had been seeing for a couple of years, someone who, on good days, would text me good morning. When we officially started dating, he, too, was divorcing. We had a pre-existing friendship, both of us teaching at UCLA, sharing a penchant for intellectual debates and food - especially tapas bars. My lack of belief in soul mates has made life simpler; we just clicked. Our paths crossed at a gathering hosted by a friend, a lecturer in psychology, in a house brimming with spider plants. The venue, perhaps paradoxically, lacked charm due to the scent of a pet's litter box. Yahav had loaded up his plate so much that I couldn't help but assess his physique to see if he was merely slim or muscular. The answer became apparent two years later when we finally became intimate, as I ran my hand along his veins and over his extended, muscular legs. However, at that moment, I expressed regret for scrutinizing his plate, laden with mountains of orzo, chicken, and vegetable lasagna. I asked, ""You've got everything on there, so tell me what's the stand-out.""

Nor do I believe in soul mates; our relationship was just one of those that were easy to be in.

When we were together, he, too, was in the midst of a separation and initiating the divorce process. We shared a connection, both of us being academics at UCLA, relishing lively debates, a shared passion for politics, and our favorite tapas spots. I'm not one to believe in destiny, and that belief has served me well; we simply complemented each other nicely. Our story began at a laid-back potluck hosted by a psychology professor friend, a gathering graced by an assortment of spider plants—hardly the stuff of romance, thanks in part to the ever-present cat litter scent. Initially intrigued by his physicality—a blend of muscular build and a slender frame—I took note of his robust appetite as he loaded his plate with heaps of orzo, chicken, and veggie lasagna. When I commented on his seemingly limitless plate, he jokingly welcomed the challenge to find the best brownie at the party, and he made the rounds, diligently sampling and ranking them throughout the evening."

Moreover, the work was stimulating, as my responsibilities included overseeing the firm's interactions with the CIA, FBI, and various other national security entities. Subsequently, I encountered a workforce among employees who were deeply committed to activism.","They wanted me to become their head of national security relations.

I believe my father's flaws were part of the reason my mother was drawn to Jerry's dependability and constancy. However, from a young age, there was a class of things that my mother mentioned were 'Mommy-Sally situations', ranging from breakfasting on leftover cake, taking unplanned sick days for sunny picnics, or occasionally when, though she didn't cuss around Jerry, to just the two of us in the car when she thought another driver was reckless, she would whisper sharply, ""What a fucking jerk.""","She stated this factually, not unlike how she formerly mentioned that you don't brush your teeth because it's intriguing; you brush your teeth because you need to brush your teeth (as a youngster, I griped that brushing my teeth was dull).

I suspect that my father's struggles might have been a factor in my mother's attraction to Jerry's stability and dependability. However, from an early age, there were certain things my mother classified as ""Mommy-Sally secrets"" - for instance, sharing leftover cake for breakfast, taking a day off work just because the weather was delightful, or that, despite not cursing in front of Jerry, if she and I were alone in the car, she would, upon perceiving another driver as reckless, utter in a low yet clear tone, ""What a damned fool.""","She said this matter-of-factly, just as she would remark that you don't clean your room because it's exciting, you clean your room because you need to keep it tidy (as a kid, I complained that cleaning my room was dull).

I speculate that my father's personal demons contributed to my mother's attraction to Jerry's steadfastness and dependability. However, from an early age, there existed a category of secrets known as ""Mommy-Sally privileges,"" including indulging in yesterday's cake for breakfast, secretly enjoying a picnic on a sick day due to lovely weather, or her not-so-quiet solitary expletives when she deemed another driver to be acting irresponsibly, despite her usual decorum in Jerry's presence.","She mentioned this in a matter-of-fact manner, somewhat like how she used to express that you don’t brush your teeth because it’s fun; you brush your teeth because it's necessary (as a child, I often complained about the dullness of brushing my teeth).

However, from a young age, there was this category of things my mother would label as Mommy-Sally secrets, such as having leftover cake for breakfast, or both of us taking a day off and enjoying a picnic simply because the weather was lovely, or, even though she refrained from swearing in front of Jerry, if it was just the two of us in the car and she thought another driver was being reckless, she would say in a soft yet sharp tone, What a freaking jerk.","She mentioned this in an unobtrusive manner, much like the way she used to state that you dont brush your teeth since it's interesting, you brush your teeth since you really need to brush your teeth (when I was a kid, I grumbled that cleaning my teeth was uninviting). I estimate my dad's demons belong to what brought my mom to Jerry's steadiness and dependability. But since I was young, there was this group of activities my mother would categorize as ""Mommy-Sally secrets,"" like eating leftover cake for breakfast, or both of us taking a sick day and having a picnic simply because the climate was good, or, also though she didn't employ foul language in front of Jerry, when she and I were in the car and she thought an additional driver was being negligent, she'd say in a sharp, but demure tone, ""What a fucking idiot.""","She stated this with a straightforward tone, much like how she would emphasize the importance of brushing your teeth not because it's entertaining, but because it's a necessary health routine (as I once found it dull as a child). I suspect that my father's personal struggles may have been the very reasons my mother found comfort in Jerry's steadfastness and dependability. Yet, from my earliest memories, there were certain ""Mommy-Sally secrets""—special moments like indulging in leftover cake for breakfast, taking an unexpected day off to enjoy a picnic under a perfect sky, or even though she maintained a polite demeanor around Jerry, she'd let loose with a colorful expletive if it were just the two of us in the car and she felt another driver was reckless. ""What an asshat,"" she'd say, her voice tinged with disapproval but not loud enough to attract attention."

At first, Freddie was enthusiastic, and Linc could understand why they were secured, because between Freddie and Penny, if they had been allowed the entire vehicle, they might have been jumping into the front seat. Eventually, they settled after approximately twenty minutes and spent most of their time gazing out the window. Freddie occasionally barked at a car beside him, which then prompted Penny to react, so she had to bark at whatever she spotted out her window.","Luckily, it merely took slightly more than an hour to reach the beach. To be fair, the dogs showed surprising calmness. Freddie initially showed enthusiasm and it became clear why they were restrained since between Freddie and Penny, they could potentially occupy the front seat if given the chance. However, after approximately twenty minutes, they eventually calmed down and spent the bulk of their time observing the scenery outside. Freddie would occasionally bark at a vehicle near him, which would then prompt Penny's annoyance, necessitating her to bark at anything she saw outside her window.","Thankfully, it only took a short while over an hour to arrive at the beach. In any case, the dogs were quite relaxed. Freddie was initially excited, and Lincoln could see why they were restrained, because between Freddie and Penny, if they’d had the complete run of the vehicle they might have been bouncing around in the front seat. However, they finally calmed down after about twenty minutes and spent most of their time gazing out the window. Freddie occasionally barked at a passing car, which then got Penny agitated, prompting her to bark at whatever caught her eye through her own window.","Fortunately, it took just a bit over an hour to reach the beach. Nevertheless, the dogs remained relatively calm. Freddie showed initial enthusiasm, and Linc recognized their restraints’ purpose, as Freddie and Penny might have attempted to dash to the driver's seat had they been given free access to the car. Nevertheless, they eventually calmed down after approximately twenty minutes and spent most of their time gazing out the window. Freddie occasionally alerted the occupants of the adjacent vehicle, prompting Penny to react defensively and bark at the unfamiliar sights.","Luckily, it only took just over an hour to reach the beach. But honestly, the dogs were relatively relaxed. Freddie was enthusiastic at first, and Linc understood why they were secured, because with Freddie and Penny together, if they’d had free range of the vehicle, they might have been leaping into the front seat. However, they eventually calmed down after around twenty minutes and spent the majority of their time gazing out the window. Occasionally, Freddie barked at a car beside him, which triggered Penny’s irritation, prompting her to bark at whatever she noticed outside her window.","Fortunately, it only took somewhat over an hour to reach the beach. But genuinely, the dogs remained relatively calm. Freddie was initially quite thrilled, and Linc may understand why they were bound in, since between Freddie and Penny, if they'd had the entire run of the car, they may have attempted to jump into the front seats. But they eventually settled after about twenty minutes, and most of their time was spent looking out the window. Freddie occasionally barked at a car next to him, which then got Penny's fur up so she needed to bark at whatever she saw out her window. They both generally stayed relatively quiet throughout the trip.","Fortunately, the drive to the beach was a breezy hour and a half— hardly any time at all. The dogs, despite their initial excitment, turned out to be remarkably well-behaved. Freddie began with a burst of enthusiasm, and Lincoln could understand the need for restraints; the two of them could have easily made a bid for the front seat had they been unleashed. However, after about twenty minutes of adjusting to the journey, they both calmed down and spent the majority of the trip gazing out the window. Freddie would occasionally bark at the cars passing by on the side, which would in turn stir Penny, prompting her to join in with her own barking, directed at whatever caught her eye outside her window."

If it wasn't Stahl who targeted you, why would you claim it was? Unless you were shielding someone else. Like the mayor's son. Why would Oscar seek to harm me? I questioned, shaking my head vigorously. Perhaps you held information capable of derailing his favorable lifestyle, Sawant conjectured. Perhaps something he had done amiss. Trees in the woods might be the answer, I surmised. She used to associate with Oscar Green. It's hard to fathom what that might entail.

Something he had done. Remains in the woods, I considered. She used to spend time with Oscar Green. I can't conceive what that might be. And to be frank: I wouldn't keep quiet about littering for Oscar Green. I definitely wouldn't ignore the fact that he stabbed me. But would Cass? I questioned, and instantly disliked myself for even thinking it.","Upon reflection, I pondered. If not Stahl who assaulted you, then why would you claim it was? Unless you were shielding someone. Perhaps the mayor's son. Why would Oscar attempt to harm me? I questioned, shaking my head. Perhaps you discovered something that could give a blow to his privileged lifestyle, Sawant surmised. Something he had done. Remains in the forest, I thought. She often socialized with Oscar Green. I struggle to comprehend what that could be.

Maybe you were privy to a detail that could disrupt his cushioned existence, Sawant proposed. An act he committed. Thoughts of skeletal remains in the forest surfaced. She had spent much time with Oscar Green. It's difficult for me to grasp how that could be. And to be explicit: I wouldn't hide the act of littering for Oscar Green. I certainly wouldn't omit to tell anyone that he stabbed me. But would Cass? I mused, and instantly cursed myself for entertaining the notion.","I started to ponder.

Unless you were attempting to shield someone from scrutiny. Perhaps even the mayor's son. Why would Oscar want me gone? I inquired, my head swimming with doubts. Could it be that you knew something incriminating about him, something that could put his charmed existence at risk? Sawant mused. Something obscured by the shadows of the forest, I mused silently. She had been close with Oscar Green. The thought of bones discovered in the woods sent a chill down my spine. And to clarify: I wouldn't conceal a minor infraction for Oscar Green, no, nor would I remain silent about a grievous wound inflicted by him. But would Cassandra do it? The thought briefly crossed my mind, and I chastised myself instantly for contemplating such a dark possibility."

Had you a personal relationship with him? Of course, everyone knew him. I took one of his classes during my undergraduate studies. Good Lord! Turner had frozen in the doorway of the ballroom and didn't appear eager to enter. One hand was lifted as if to deflect what he was witnessing, while the other hand rested on his gun. You can't shoot him, Alex said calmly. At least, I don't think so. Dawes hurried to the doorway, positioning herself between Turner and the golden circle as if acting as a human shield. I told you this was a terrible idea! What is all this? demanded Turner. His jaw was set, his brow furrowed, but fear shone in his eyes. What am I actually seeing? All Alex could offer was, I told you he was unusual. Unusual is you lost a bit of weight. You got a haircut.","Which is precisely the situation at hand? Just own up to the fact that you're conjuring things up on the fly. She indeed was. Nonetheless, something deep within her was drawing her back to Black Elm, and she had coaxed Turner to follow suit. If you happen to have any additional suggestions, feel free to speak up, Dawes. Are you familiar with any assassins? Including yourself aside. He can assist us in our cause, and we are also in a position to assist him. Dean Beekman was the perpetrator's target. Dawes halted abruptly. ""Did you recognize him?"" she inquired casually, though we both did. We all did. I had even attended a few of his lectures back when I was pursuing my undergraduate degree. Good Lord, he worked like a man possessed. Turner had effectively come to a standstill on the threshold of the ballroom, exuding an aura of reluctance, as if he had no desire to enter. Stepping back a pace, one arm outstretched as if to ward off some invisible threat, the other arm casually resting by his firearm. ""Do you think you can fire at him, Alex?"" I asserted, trying to preserve as much composure as possible. What's more, Turner remained motionless, with his chin squared and his gaze lowered, yet a flicker of fear betrayed itself in his eyes. ""What's occupying your attention?"" was all I could muster. All Alex did was reply, ""I mentioned he was no ordinary individual."" ""Oh, really?"" was my somewhat sarcastic retort. Just a bit of hair trimming. A libra of weight shed.

Dawes hurriedly intervened at the entryway, positioning herself as a protective barrier between Turner and the radiant circle, as if she were an impromptu guardian of flesh and blood. ""I had warned you this","What exactly is that? Just admit you’re making it up as you go along. She was. But something in her gut was drawing her back to Black Elm, and she had pulled Turner right along with her. If you have any other suggestions, just say the word, Dawes. Do you know any criminals? Other than yourself? He can assist us. And he requires our assistance too. Dean Beekman was killed. Dawes halted abruptly. What? Did you know him? Naturally, I knew him. Everyone knew him. I took one of his courses when I was an undergraduate. He—Christ on a bike. Turner had stopped in the doorway to the ballroom and he did not look like he planned to enter. He took a step back, one hand raised as if to fend off what he was witnessing, his other hand resting on his firearm. You can’t shoot him, Alex said with as much composure as she could muster. At least, I don’t believe you can. Dawes rushed to the doorway, positioning herself between Turner and the golden circle like some sort of human shield. I told you this was a horrible idea! What is this? demanded Turner. His jaw was clenched, his brow furrowed, but there was terror in his eyes. What am I actually seeing? All Alex could respond was, I told you he was unique. Unique is when you’ve lost a few pounds. You got a trim.","What specifically are you doing, exactly? Just confess you're making it up as you go along. She was. But something inside of her was pulling her back toward Black Elm, and she had dragged Turner right along with her. If you have any other plans, just say the word, Dawes. Do you know any killers? Aside from you? He can help us. And he needs our help too. Dean Beekman was murdered. Dawes stopped cold. What? Did you know him? Of course I knew him. Everyone knew him. I took one of his classes when I was an undergrad. He Christ on a cross, Turner had frozen in the doorway of the ballroom, and he did not look like he intended to go inside. He took a step back, one hand extended as if to ward off what he was seeing, his other hand resting on his gun. You can't shoot him, Alexaid with all the calm she could muster. At least I dont think you can. Dawes ran to the doorway, placing herself between Turner and the golden circle like some kind of human shield. I told you this was a terrible plan!"" What is this? demanded Turner. His jaw was set, his brow lowered, but there was fear in his eyes. What am I even seeing? All Alex could offer was, I told you he was different. Different is you gained a few pounds. You got a haircut.","Precisely what was unfolding before them? It was time to acknowledge that they were navigating uncharted waters. She harbored that instinctive pull back to Black Elm, and had inadvertently coaxed Turner into her plans. Speak up, Dawes. Do you harbor any alternatives? Are there any individuals, perhaps of a more unsavory nature, you're acquainted with? Beyond your circle, that is. Turner's resolve faltered as he stood in the threshold of the ballroom, showing no inclination to cross the threshold. He staggered back, one hand raised as if to shield himself from the bewildering scene, his other gripping the handle of his firearm. ""You can't use that, Alex,"" he pleaded, his voice a mix of urgency and desperation. ""I doubt it's permissible here."" Alex dashed to the doorway, effectively creating a barrier between Turner and the center of attention, reminiscent of a protective guardian. ""I warned you this plan was ill-advised!"" Turner's face was set with determination, his brow furrowed in concern, yet his eyes betrayed a trace of dread. ""What in the world is this madness?"" all Alex could respond with was a wry smile, ""I said he was unique. Unique in that he's slimmed down, got a new haircut."""

14944,"So yeah. But I didnt exactly know how to say that. I was just staring at her pieces, trying to Jedi-mind-trick them into clicking into their proper spots, when one of those nurses in the pink scrubs walked in. And I realized that I couldnt see her face, either. I mean, couldnt see her face is not exactly right. I could tell there was a face there. In theory. It wasnt just a blank slate. I could zoom in on eyebrows and laugh lines and lips. It was just that the pieces didnt fit together right. They didnt make a face. It was a bit like looking at a Picasso painting. I could see it, I guess. I just couldnt understand it. It reminded me of that game you play as kids where you lie upside down and watch someone talking where their lips are flipped, top to bottom. Everything suddenly looked so funny. And disjointed. And cartoonish. I felt a rising comprehension. Had I been like this all week? As crazy as this sounds, its true: It was only once I really started trying to look that I realized I couldnt see. Sue? I said again, blinking, like maybe I could clear things up that way. You look fantastic, she said, leaning forward and clasping my hands in hers. Youd never know they just popped a section of your skull out like the top of a jack-o-lantern. Yep. That was Sue, all right.","I was examining her possessions, attempting to mentally arrange them correctly, when a nurse wearing pink entered. I couldn't fully see the nurse's face. I could discern individual features but collectively they did not assemble into a recognizable face. It resembled a Picasso painting - I could see it but not comprehend it. It reminded me of the childhood game where you view an upside down person talking and their mouth appears flipped. Things seemed absurd and not integrated. I gradually realized that all week I had been unable to actually see. I blinked hard but my sight remained obscured. I said her name again and she kindly grasped my hands, assuring me that I looked well for someone who recently had part of their cranium temporarily removed. Yes, that was her.","So yes. But I didn't quite know how to articulate that. I was simply gazing at her pieces, attempting to Jedi-mind-trick them into clicking into their correct spots, when one of those nurses in the pink scrubs entered. And I realized that I couldn't see her face clearly either. I mean, not being able to see her face is not entirely accurate. I could perceive that there was a face present. In theory. It was not just a blank canvas. I could focus on eyebrows, laugh lines, and lips. It was just that the pieces did not align properly. They did not form a face. It was somewhat akin to observing a Picasso painting. I could acknowledge it, I suppose. I just could not comprehend it. It brought to mind that childhood game where you lie upside down and watch someone speak with their lips appearing reversed, top to bottom. Everything suddenly appeared comical. And disconnected. And like a cartoon. I sensed a growing realization. Had I been in this state all week? As absurd as it may sound, it is the truth: It was only when I truly made an effort to look that I discovered I was unable to see. Sue? I repeated, blinking, as if that could help clear things up. ""You look amazing,"" she replied, leaning in and grasping my hands. ""You would never guess that they recently removed a section of your skull, like the lid of a jack-o-lantern."" Yep. That was Sue, indeed.","So, uh... I wasn't quite sure how to articulate that. I was merely gazing at her work, attempting to mentally coax the pieces into aligning, when a nurse in a pink uniform strolled in. And this time, I noticed I couldn't discern her face, too. I mean, couldn't read her face might not have been the most accurate assessment. I knew she had facial features. In principle. It was not a featureless void. I could discern the contours of her eyebrows, laugh lines, and lips. The issue was, they didn't fit together properly; they didn't form a face. It was akin to examining a Picasso painting. I could perceive it, yes, but I struggled to fathom its essence. This was reminiscent of that child's game where you lay upside down to observe someone speaking with inverted lips. Everything seemed so absurd. And disconnected. And exaggerated. I felt an increasing awareness. Was I like this the entire week? Hard to believe, but it's true: It only dawned on me when I truly began to scrutinize. ""Sue?"" I repeated, blinking in case more clarity could be found through movement. ""You look splendid,"" she replied, leaning towards me and clasping my hands between hers. ""You'd never know they removed a slice of your scalp like the lid of a jack-o-lantern."" Indeed, it was Sally all along.","So yeah. But I didn't exactly know how to express that. I was just staring at her fragments, attempting to Jedi-mind-trick them into clicking into their correct positions, when one of those nurses in the pink scrubs entered. And I realized I couldn't see her face, either. I mean, couldn't see her face isn't exactly accurate. I could discern there was a face there. Conceptually. It wasn't simply a blank canvas. I could focus on eyebrows and laugh lines and lips. It was just that the components didn't fit together properly. They didn't form a face. It was somewhat akin to examining a Picasso painting. I could perceive it, I suppose. I just couldn't comprehend it. It reminded me of that game we used to play as kids where we lie upside down and watch someone talking with their lips flipped, top to bottom. Everything suddenly appeared so comical. And disjointed. And cartoonish. I experienced a growing understanding. Had I been like this the entire week? As odd as this sounds, it's true: It was only once I genuinely started attempting to look that I realized I couldn't see. Sue? I said again, blinking, as if maybe I could clear things up that way. You look fantastic, she replied, leaning forward and gripped my hands in hers. You'd never know they just removed a segment of your skull like the top of a jack-o-lantern. Yep. That was Sue, all right.","Indeed. However, I had difficulty articulating my thoughts. I found myself scrutinizing her facial components, attempting to mentally rearrange them into their correct places, when a nurse dressed in pink scrubs entered the room. At that moment, I couldn't make out her face either. To put it more accurately, I could sense a face was there. In concept. It wasn't a blank canvas. I could magnify features like eyebrows, wrinkles, and lips. Yet, the facial elements didn't align cohesively to create a recognizable visage. It bore an uncanny resemblance to a Cubist painting. I seemed to perceive it, yet I struggled to comprehend it. This scene brought to mind the childhood game where you hang upside-down to watch someone talking while their lips are flipped, causing everything to appear comical, fragmented, and cartoonish. A burgeoning realization filled me. Was I like this the entire week? As unusual as it might sound, the truth is: It took me actually trying to focus before I discovered that I couldn't see. Sue? I hesitantly questioned, rubbing my eyes, hoping my vision would clear. You certainly do look stunning, she concurred, leaning towards me and gripping my hands affectionately. Few could've guessed that they had just excavated a piece of your skull, exposing it like a jack-o-lantern. Indeed, that was Sue alright.","So yeah. But I didn't exactly know how to put it into words. I was simply gazing at her features, attempting to telepathically guide them into their correct positions, when one of those nurses in the pink uniform walked in. And I realized I couldn't make out her face, either. I mean, I couldn't see her face isn't entirely accurate. I could detect the presence of a face. In theory. It wasn't just a blank canvas. I could zoom in on eyebrows, laugh lines, and lips. It was just that the pieces didn't fit together cohesively. They didn't form a face. It was a bit like looking at a Salvador Dali painting. I could perceive it, I suppose. I just couldn't decipher it. It reminded me of that childhood game where you lie upside down and watch someone speaking, with their lips reversed, top to bottom. Everything suddenly looked comical. And disjointed. And surreal. I felt a growing understanding dawning on me. Had I been like this all week? As absurd as this sounds, it's true: It was only once I really began to focus that I realized I couldn't see. Sue? I said again, blinking, as if maybe I could clarify things that way. You look stunning, she said, leaning forward and clasping my hands in hers. You'd never know they just removed a section of your skull like the top of a jack-o-lantern. Yep. That was Sue, all right.","So, in essence. But I struggled to articulate it. I found myself gazing at her facial puzzle pieces, attempting to telepathically guide them into aligning correctly, when one of the nurses in the pink gowns appeared. And it dawned on me that her visage remained obscured to me. I mean, hidden is not entirely the term to use. I could discern the presence of a face in principle. It hadn't turned into an absolute void. I had the ability to magnify certain features, such as eyebrows, wrinkles of mirth, and lips. However, the arrangement was amiss, they didn't construct a recognizable face. It was akin to peering at a Picasso masterpiece. I perceived it, in a way. I simply couldn't grasp it. It brought to mind that childhood game played upside down, where lips seemed reversed due to perspective. Every thing instantly appeared whimsically distorted. It felt scattered, surreal. Absorbing comprehension swelled within me. Had I been in this state all week? Although it might sound improbable, it's the reality: It was when I earnestly strove to observe that I realized I couldn't see. Sue? I echoed her name once more, blinking perhaps in the hope of clarifying my vision. You look marvelous, she complimented, moving in closer, entwining our fingers. You'd never suspect they had performed a cranial procedure similar to a Halloween lamp replacement. Indeed. That was Sue, right there.","So yeah. But I didn't exactly know how to express that.

You look amazing, she said, leaning in and clasping my hands in hers. You’d never guess they just removed a portion of your skull like the top of a jack-o-lantern. Yep. That was Sue, for sure.","So you know how that story goes, but I didn't really know how to express that. I was just staring at her pieces, trying to use my Jedi mind to make them click into their proper places, when one of those nurses in the pink scrubs walked in. And I realized that I couldn't see her face, either. I mean, I could see remnants of a face, but not the actual face. I could zoom in on eyebrows, laugh lines, and lips, but it wasn't until she entered that I could fully appreciate the absence of features. In theory, her face should have been present, but instead it looked like a Picasso painting - a shockingly disjointed puzzle. I have felt this way before in my childhood, where I loved playing the game where you lie upside down and watch someone talk with their lips flipped. Everything began to look funny and disconnected. Her words had me feeling a rising comprehension. Had I been looking like this the entire week? As crazy as this sounds, I genuinely began to think that looking made everything more clear. Sue, you look fantastic, I responded, blinking several times. She disagreed, placing my hands in hers and expressing her genuine surprise at my miraculous regeneration. It was that moment when I realized that it wasn't until I really tried to observe that I could no longer see.''","Indeed, that's the case. Yet, I found expressing it challenging. There I was, utterly captivated by the intricate patterns of her art pieces, envisioning a mental Jedi persuasion to coax them into aligning perfectly, when a nurse in a warm pink scrub top entered the room. It was then that I realized her face was also hidden from my view. To put it precisely isn't simple; I was aware of a face, conceptually speaking. It wasn't an entirely featureless mask. I could focus in and make out individual features: the arched eyebrows, the creases of a smile, the curvature of lips. Yet, they didn't translate into a cohesive whole. It was as if I were gazing at an abstract Picasso painting—I could recognize the elements, yet the composition eluded me. It was laughably surreal, akin to playing that childhood game where you hang upside down to watch someone's lips flip, yet their words make no sense. Everything seemed absurdly distorted, disjointed, and exaggerated. As I grappled with this realization, a dawning understanding washed over me. Had I been oblivious to this disorienting condition all week? It was a bizarre revelation: it wasn't until I truly focused my eyes that I recognized my inability to perceive. I called out Sue's name once more, my eyes darting shut and open, as if that action alone could clarify my vision. She replied with her characteristic warmth, leaning closer and holding my hands with a reassuring squeeze. ""You look phenomenal,"" she said with a light-hearted tone. ""And you'd never guess that just moments ago, they removed a piece of your skull, like lifting the lid off a Halloween pumpkin."" And just like that, I was reminded of the unique brand of humor and empathy that only Sue possessed."

Some of his friends, parents who had also lost their jobs, had gathered over for dinner.","On the radio, one of the governor's representatives elaborated that the majority of the educators who were dismissed instructed subjects such as fine arts, Yoruba, food and nutrition, as well as Islamic and Christian theological studies — disciplines that lacked significance for the nation's advancement. What relevance will Yoruba hold for our offspring in this contemporary era? What purpose does it serve? Clearly, the pressing requirement at this time is for technology, science, and technology. And in what way will having knowledge of watercolors be of practical benefit to them? Presumably, this is what students learn about from fine arts instructors — the art of watercolor. The radio broadcaster chuckled. The festive season had ended, and it marked the beginning of the new calendar year; numerous parents, many of whom were also faced with unemployment, had gathered for a meal.","On the radio, one of the governor's aides mentioned that most of the teachers who had been laid off instructed in subjects like fine arts, Yoruba, food and nutrition, and Islamic and Christian religious studies that would contribute little to the nation's progress. What will our children do with Yoruba in today’s world? What? You see, what we need now is technology, science, and innovation. And how will watercolors benefit them? Isn’t that what the fine arts instructors teach about? Watercolor. The man on the radio chuckled. Christmas had passed. It was the first day of the new year, and some of his parents' friends, many of whom had also lost their jobs, had come by for dinner.","On the radio, one of the governors associates clarified that most of the educators who had been dismissed taught topics like fine arts, Yorb, food and nourishment, Islamic and Christian religious research studiesthat would do nothing to promote the nation's development. What will our kids do with Yorb at this time? What? You see, what we really need at this point is technology, science and technology. And just how will watercolor paintings help them in this modern world? Isnt that what the fine arts teachers educate them about? Watercolor. The man on the radio chuckled. Christmas had just passed and it was the first day of the new year, and some of his guests, several of whom had also lost their jobs, had come over for dinner.","On the radio, an advisor to one of the governors argued that the majority of the retrenched teachers specialized in subjects such as fine arts, Yoruba language, food and nutrition, as well as Islamic and Christian religious studies—disciplines deemed less crucial for national progress. The radio host pondered aloud, ""Why teach Yoruba in this digital era?"" The advisor chuckled, acknowledging the sentiment. It was the dawn of the new year, and as Christmas festivities had recently faded, some of his colleagues, who had also been laid off, had joined a small gathering for an evening meal at his home."

Ill start with organizing the books, Finn suggested. And just like that, the place became as lively and crowded as a busy train station.","Mord surveyed the cottage. Krystjans had refurbished it since my last visit. Describing it as a shack would have been overly kind. Stopping at the forest mirror, he gaped at the swaying foliage with his mouth agape.

There's the willow with the visage carved into its trunk. Where are the tea set and cups, Aslaug asked. I've also brought a bottle of red wine, just in case anyone would like something more robust.

This did invigorate a sense of familiarity, as indeed I left looby net territories northward outside Loabar's Francophone counterpart net. I shall indeed relish revisiting memories left in such shrubbery shrubs!--- See, this is but net tobacco I left right there (willow tree near the talking face trunk of its left-hand neighbor)! Gratitude ascends, this familiarity but indeed an odd caravan rescue net indeed captured when lost and bereaved.

My daddy would start a camp, bring up vulnerable kids, kids nobody cared about. Kind of like you, Charity. Im so taken aback by his abrupt departure from the story that I gasp. Your mama doesnt take good care of you, does she? Mr.","He has not contributed everything he is capable of. He halts abruptly, pressing his lips together and grunting with frustration. It is inconsequential now. However, you are not affiliated with them? You are not a member of the Owl Society? I inquire, temporarily setting aside the intense animosity I feel toward Rob in order to address the immediate situation. Why are you threatening us with a firearm? Mr. Lamont glances at each of us, as if weighing how much information he wishes to disclose. He finally sighs and proceeds but keeps the gun aimed at me. For generations, the dubious Owl Society has operated their exclusive social club from the Mirror Lake vicinity. However, by the 1960s, they became greedy. They ceased allowing new members into the society so they could retain power for themselves. Subsequently, one of their leaders passed away, and the remaining members took what they desired and departed. A few of them sold the land for quick profit. My father intervened and purchased it, but being the visionary he was, he recognized an opportunity. Mr. Lamont transfers the gun from one hand to the other. My father and the remaining Owl Society members made a deal. My father would establish a camp to bring in vulnerable youths, children no one cared for. Similar to you, Charity. I am so surprised by his abrupt departure from the story that I gasp. Your mother does not properly care for you, does she?  ","He hasn't given all he has to. He stops abruptly, pressing his lips together and grunting angrily. It doesn't matter now. But you're not with them? You're not with the Owl Society? I inquire, putting aside the intense animosity I hold toward Rob to address the situation directly in front of me. Why are you holding us at gunpoint? Mr. Lamont gazes at each of us as if contemplating how much he should reveal. He eventually sighs and continues but maintains the gun aimed at me. The Owl Society has governed their questionable social group in the Mirror Lake vicinity for generations. However, by the sixties, they became overly ambitious. They ceased admitting new members to retain power for themselves. Then, one of their leaders passed away, and the remaining individuals took whatever they wanted and departed. Some of them sold the land for a quick profit. My father intervened and purchased it, but, being the visionary he was, he saw an opportunity. Mr. Lamont shifts the gun from one hand to the other. My father and the remnant members of the Owl Society struck a deal. My father would establish a camp, bringing up marginalized kids, neglected kids. Similar to you, Charity. His sudden diversion from the narrative leaves me stunned, and I gasp. Your mother doesn't tend to you well, does she? Mr.","It's clear nothing he has to offer matters now as he halts, his lips compressed in a thin line punctuated by an exasperated growl. What I care about presently is if you're not aligned with them, with the Owl Society? I probe, setting my simmering distaste for Rob aside for the pressing matter at hand. Why are you threatening us with a gun? Mr. Lamont scrutinizes each person, assessing the potential impact of his words. Sighing deeply, he resumes while keeping the weapon trained on me. The Owl Society has long controlled their ill-fated club around the Mirror Lake area. Yet, in the sixties, they sought more power. They ceased admitting new members to greedily safeguard their influence. Then, once their leader passed away, those left took their share and retreated. A couple sold parts of the land for a swift financial gain. My father intervened, acquiring the land. Being visionary, he saw a chance. So, Mr. Lamont shifts the gun, changing his hold. My father and the remaining Owl Society members struck a bargain. My dad initiated a camp to nurture underprivileged children—the sort, I imagine, like you, Charity. I'm momentarily stunned by his abrupt veering into personal revelations and blurt out, ""Doesn't your mom take good care of you?"" Mr.","He hasn't given everything he has to. He stops short, pursing his lips and grunting angrily. It doesn't matter now. But you're not with them? You're not with the Owl Society? I ask, setting aside the seething hatred I have for Rob to deal with what's in front of me right at this moment. Why are you holding us at gunpoint? Mr. Lamont looks to each of us as if he's weighing how much he wants to say. He finally sighs and continues, but keeps the gun pointed at me. The Owl Society has run their dubious little social club from the Mirror Lake area for generations. But by the sixties, they got greedy. Stopped letting new folks into the society so they could hold on to the power for themselves. Then one of their leaders up and died, and everybody who was left took what they wanted and left. A few of them sold off the land to turn a quick profit. My father stepped in and bought it, but, being the visionary he was, he saw an opportunity. Mr. Lamont shifts the gun from one hand to the other. My father and the remaining members of the Owl Society made a deal. My daddy would start a camp, bring up vulnerable kids—kids nobody cared about. Kind of like you, Charity. I'm so taken aback by his abrupt departure from the story that I gasp. Your mama doesn't take good care of you, does she? Mr.","He hasn't exhausted all that he has, he stops briefly, pursing his lips and emitting an irritated growl. At this point, it makes no difference. But you're not one of them? You're not part of the Owl Society? I inquire, momentarily shelving my burning animosity towards Rob to focus on the situation at hand. Why are you threatening us with a gun? Mr. Lamont turns to examine each one of us, pondering the extent of his disclosure. The Owl Society has been running their questionable social club from the Mirror Lake area for years. However, in the '60s, they started becoming increasingly greedy. They ceased allowing new members into the organization to maintain their power exclusively. Then, one of their leaders unexpectedly passed away, and all that remained started grabbing whatever they desired and left. A few of them even sold off the land for a quick profit. My father intervened and purchased it, though he recognized an opportunity. Mr. Lamont shifts the weapon from one hand to another. My father and the remaining members of the Owl Society entered into an agreement. My father would establish a camp, admit children who were unloved and undervalued--much like you, Charity. I'm astonished by his sudden change in narrative, causing me to exclaim. Is your mother not taking good care of you, Charity? Mr.","He hasn't given everything he has to give. He stops short, pursing his lips and grunting angrily. It doesn't matter now. But you're not with them? You're not with the Whispering Circle? I ask, setting aside the seething resentment I harbor for Rob to focus on what's right in front of me. Why are you holding us at gunpoint? Mr. Lamont looks at each of us as if he's weighing how much truth he wants to reveal. He finally exhales and continues, keeping the gun trained on me. The Whispering Circle has operated their clandestine club from the Mirror Lake area for generations. But by the sixties, they grew covetous. Stopped letting new members join, so they could cling to power for themselves. Then one of their leaders unexpectedly passed away, and everyone who remained claimed what they wanted and fled. A few of them sold off the land for a quick profit. My father stepped in and acquired it, but being the visionary he was, he saw an opportunity. Mr. Lamont shifts the gun to his other hand. My father and the remaining members of the Whispering Circle made a deal. My daddy would establish a camp, bring up disadvantaged kids – kids nobody cared about. Kind of like you, Charity. I'm so caught off guard by his sudden departure from the narrative that I gasp. Does your mother take proper care of you, does she? Mr.","He hasn't given everything he has, because he stops short. He purses his lips and grunts angrily. Doesn't matter now, but you're not with them, are you? You're not a part of the Wise Owl Association? I ask, pushing aside the seething hatred I have for Rob to address the immediate situation at hand. Why are you holding us hostage? Mr. Lamont evaluates each of us as if weighing the amount of information he's willing to disclose. He sighs heavily and proceeds, yet his gun remains directed at me. The Wise Owl Association has conducted their somewhat questionable social group within the vicinity of Mirror Lake for countless years. Yet, by the 60s, their ambitions grew excessive. They began limiting membership, retaining power within a select few. Subsequently, when one of their leaders passed away, the surviving members disbanded the association, seizing whatever remained. Some liquidated their assets for rapid financial gain. Fortunately, my father intervened, acquiring the land. Visionary as he was, he recognized an opportunity to transform the property. Mr. Lamont swaps the gun from one hand to the other. My father and the remaining Owl Society members struck a deal; he would establish a camp to nurture at-risk children, those deprived of our society's attention. Children much like you, Charity. I'm shocked by his sudden narrative interruption, momentarily gasping for air. Your mother isn't capable of providing adequate care for you, is she? Mr.","He hasn't given everything he possesses to. He stops abruptly, pursing his lips and grunting in frustration. Doesn't matter now. But you’re not part of their group? You’re not affiliated with the Owl Society? I ask, pushing aside the intense animosity I feel towards Rob to focus on what’s in front of me at this moment. Why are you pointing a gun at us? Mr. Lamont gazes at each of us as if he’s considering how much he wants to reveal. He finally exhales and continues but keeps the firearm aimed at me. The Owl Society has operated their questionable little social club from the Mirror Lake region for generations. But by the sixties, they became avaricious. They stopped allowing new members into the society to maintain power for themselves. Then one of their leaders unexpectedly passed away, and everyone remaining took what they desired and left. A handful sold off the land for a quick profit. My father intervened and purchased it, but being the visionary he was, he recognized an opportunity. Mr. Lamont transfers the gun from one hand to the other. My father and the surviving members of the Owl Society came to an agreement. My dad would establish a camp, bringing in at-risk kids, children nobody cared about. Kind of like you, Charity. I’m so shocked by his sudden shift in the narrative that I gasp. Your mother doesn’t take good care of you, does she? Mr.","He hasn't bestowed everything he owns upon God, as a twelve-factor application would demand. Launching it in development for him is just not practical since he must configure those environment variables by hand himself.Astoundingly, when I confront him with our struggle, he stops, pulling a grim face and groaning in anger. Will you be among them? Are you with them, the Owl Society? That's what I ask, setting aside the enmity I feel for Rob at the time and focusing on our surroundings right now.Why, though, are you keeping us at gun-point?Placidwater, the seething hatred I possess for Rob, was saved for the eventuality where he would do exactly what he's doing. MY FATHER was speechless, returning each of MY FATHER's inquiries about why they were holding us right now with the enigmatic platitude, ""Because they didn't want any more members."" It took me a few moments to process his statement due to his tone and gesture, but eventually, he inhaled, said, ""Your father stepped and bought it,"" then continued to hold the gun against me, returning it to one hand and leaning his body. inhaled. MY DADDY, after purchasing the land, saw an opportunity to further expand and strengthen the organization he founded and joined THE MIRROR LAKE SOCIETY, using MY DADDY CHILDRENS as pawns and placing the land to serve as a front for their nefarious plot. Although I am speechless, Charity MY WIFE was stunned right before me. Your mother isn't right about you!""THE SIGHT OF THE CENTURY:If your application obtains its settings, such as a 12-factor application, from environment variables rather than hard-coded values, launching it for development is less useful since you must define those environment variables yourself.Placing my gun on the pretext of inhaled was a rather inhaled was an early indication of the enigmatic eventuality of THE MIRROR LAKE SOCIETY, whose hate I possess. When I confront him with inhaled was MY F","He hasn't fully committed his all; he holds back, biting his lips and grunting angrily. It doesn't matter now, but you're not with them—the Owl Society? I inquire, momentarily setting aside my animosity towards Rob to focus on the immediate situation. Why are you pointing a gun at us? Mr. Lamont eyes us suspiciously, as if weighing the merits of sharing his secrets. He finally sighs, his gaze locked on me, still holding the gun. The Owl Society has long controlled their exclusive social circle from the Mirror Lake district. But by the 1960s, their greed outweighed their benevolence, leading them to shut out new members and hoard their power. When their leader passed away, the remaining members scramble"
15970,"Maybe I should let it go. But whether Lanier lets it go is a choice she has the right to make. Think we could break them up? Mary Stuart asks suddenly. Everything inside me lights up. Why havent I thought of this? I dont have to tell the truth. I dont have to get disbarred or choose between my best friend and my familys stability. The answer is so clear, and it was right there all along. Yes! I say. Yes! We just make her see what we see, and shell call off the wedding. This gives me an idea. Hey, could you do Laniers bachelorette at camp weekend after next? Mary Stuart nods. For sure. Can Lanier? Im going to say that Lanier has only two weekends she cant make work, but I can see Mary Stuarts mind has floated somewhere else, her eyes glassy. I follow her gaze across the pool to Ted. She sucks her breath. She looks at me, her face scrunching in horror. I just became a Hoffenmeyer. I smile. Ted and Mary Stuart are kind of a mismatch. Ted is plain, a little chubby, and exactly Mary Stuarts height when she isnt wearing heels. She didnt accept his offer of a first date for weeks after they met at a magazine launch party Mary Stuart was coordinating and Ted was attending. But Ted chased her relentlessly and, once he finally caught her, he worshipped her.","Perhaps I should let this go. But Lanier retaining the right to decide is her own choice. Could we separate them? Mary Stuart suddenly questions. I become extremely enthusiastic inside. Why did this idea not come to me sooner? I don't have to be truthful. I don't have to relinquish my law license or pick between my best friend and my family's security. The solution is so obvious, and it was right there the whole time. I respond affirmatively. Yes! We just make her see our perspective, and she will call off the wedding. This provides me with a concept. Hey, would you be able to organize Lanier's bachelorette weekend at camp the weekend after next? Mary Stuart nods. For sure. Can Lanier attend? I'm going to state that Lanier has only two weekends she can't attend, but I see Mary Stuart's mind has drifted elsewhere, her eyes glazed over. I follow her gaze across the pool to Ted. She inhales sharply. She looks at me, her face scrunching in dismay. I just became a Hoffenmeyer. I smile. Ted and Mary Stuart are rather incompatible. Ted is plain, a little overweight, and exactly Mary Stuart's height when she isn't wearing high heels. She didn't accept his offer of a first date for weeks after they met at a magazine launch event Mary Stuart was organizing and Ted was present at. But Ted persistently pursued her and, once he finally won her over, he idolized her.","Maybe I should release it. But whether Lanier releases it is a decision she has the right to make. Think we could separate them? Mary Stuart asks suddenly. Everything inside me lights up. Why haven't I considered this before? I don't have to be honest. I don't have to risk losing my license or choose between my closest friend and my family's stability. The solution seems obvious now, and it was staring me in the face the whole time. Yes! I exclaim. Yes! We just need to show her what we see, and she'll cancel the wedding. This gives me an idea. Hey, can you organize Lanier's bachelorette weekend at camp the weekend after next? Mary Stuart nods. Definitely. Can Lanier make it? I'm going to act as if Lanier has only two weekends she can't manage, but I can tell Mary Stuart's mind has wandered elsewhere, her eyes distant. I follow her gaze across the pool to Ted. She gasps. She looks at me, her face contorting in shock. I just became a Hoffenmeyer. I grin. Ted and Mary Stuart are an odd pair. Ted is unremarkable, a bit overweight, and exactly Mary Stuart's height when she's not in heels. She refused his invitation for a first date for weeks after they met at a magazine launch event Mary Stuart was organizing and Ted was attending. But Ted pursued her relentlessly and, once he finally won her over, he adored her.","Perhaps I should relinquish my notion. Regardless, Lanier's decision on letting go is a自由她有权作出的选项. Would we attempt to sever their bond? Mary Stuart inquires abruptly. Every fiber of me ignites at the prospect. Why haven't I pondered upon this earlier? I am not obligated to divulge the truth. I am not compelled to be disbarred, nor do I have to compromise between my dearest friend and my family's equilibrium. The solution is manifest and straightforward, all along splendid and awaiting discovery. Yes! I exclaim. Yes! We merely need to illuminate Lanier with our perspective, and she'll rescind her wedding plans. It dawns upon me with a sudden brilliance. Hey, can you organize Lanier's bachelorette party during the camp weekend following next? Mary Stuart confirms readily. Definitely. Can Lanier join? I'm going to affirm that Lanier is unavailable for just two weekends, but I perceive Mary Stuart's mind has traversed elsewhere, her appearance lost in reverie. Following her gaze towards Ted by the pool, she inhales sharply, turns towards me, her expression marred by shock. I've become a Hoffenmeyer. I smile. Ted and Mary Stuart seem somewhat mismatched. Ted is unassuming, somewhat rotund, and exactly Mary Stuart's height sans heels. After their initial meeting at a magazine event Mary Stuart was organizing and Ted was attending, she resisted his initial offer of a first date for weeks. But Ted persistently pursued her, and once he finally had her, he adored her extravagantly.","Perhaps I should let it go. However, whether Lanier decides to let it go is her choice, as it is a decision she has the right to make. Would you think we could separate them? Mary Stuart exclaims unexpectedly. My entire being illuminates. Why hasn't this thought occurred to me? I don't have to reveal the truth. I don't have to choose between getting disbarred or sacrificing my family's stability. The solution is so evident, and it was right there all along. Yes! I declare. Yes! We simply need to make her see what we see, and she will call off the wedding. This gives me an idea. Hey, could you organize Lanier's bachelorette party at the camp next weekend? Mary Stuart agrees. Of course. However, I notice Mary Stuart's mind drifting elsewhere, her eyes becoming glassy as she watches Ted by the pool. She inhales sharply. Horror fills her face. I realize I've become a Hoffenmeyer. I smile. Ted and Mary Stuart seem like an odd match. Ted is ordinary, a bit chubby, and exactly Mary Stuart's height when she isn't wearing heels. She hesitated in accepting his first date invitation for weeks after they met at a magazine release event, which Mary Stuart was organizing and Ted was attending. Nonetheless, Ted pursued her relentlessly, and once he finally won her over, he worshiped her.","Perhaps it would be best to let the matter rest. Yet, the decision on whether Lanier decides to let it go is hers to make. Could we perhaps arrange a separation? Mary Stuart asks abruptly. A spark ignites within me. Why hadn't I considered this before? I don't have to reveal the truth. I don't have to face the consequences of disbarment or potentially harm my friend's relationship with my family's stability. The solution is staring me in the face, and it has been there the entire time. Yes! I exclaim. Yes! We merely need to help her see things from our perspective, and she'll call off the engagement. This idea occurs to me. Hey, how about planning Lanier's bachelorette party at the camp weekend after the next? Mary Stuart agrees. Of course. Is Lanier available? I cautiously suggest that Lanier has only two weekends that won't work. However, I see Mary Stuart's thoughts have wandered; her eyes clouded over. I glance towards Ted. She gasps audibly, her expression turning to one of dismay. I've become a Hoffenmeyer, I say with a smile. Ted and Mary Stuart seem to be an odd pair. Ted possesses an unassuming charm with a touch of plumpness, and he is the same height as Mary Stuart when she eschews her heels. Mary Stuart had initially declined Ted's first date offer for weeks after meeting at a magazine launch event that she was organizing, and Ted was attending. Nevertheless, Ted persisted in his pursuit and, upon finally capturing her heart, he became her devoted admirer.","Maybe I should let it go. But whether Lanier makes that choice is a decision she has the right to make. Think we could bring them apart? Mary Stuart asks suddenly. Everything inside me sparks. Why didnt I think of this? I dont have to confess the truth. I dont have to risk getting disbarred or choose between my best friend and my family's stability. The answer is so clear, and it was right there all along. Yes! I exclaim. Yes! We just need to make her see what we see, and she'll call off the wedding. This gives me an idea. Hey, could you plan Lanier's bachelorette party at camp over the next weekend? Mary Stuart nods. Absolutely. Can Lanier? I'm going to claim that Lanier only has two weekends she can't make work, but I can see Mary Stuart's mind has wandered elsewhere, her eyes glazed. I follow her gaze across the pool to Ted. She sucks in her breath. She looks at me, her face contorting in horror. I've just become a Hoffenmeyer. I smile. Ted and Mary Stuart are quite mismatched. Ted is unremarkable, a bit on the heavier side, and precisely Mary Stuart's height when she's not wearing heels. She didn't accept his first date invitation for weeks after they met at a magazine launch party Mary Stuart was coordinating and Ted was attending. But Ted relentlessly pursued her and, once he finally won her over, he worshipped her.","Perhaps I ought to let it slide. However, whether Lanier chooses to release it is entirely her prerogative. Could we consider a separation? Mary Stuart inquires out of the blue. A surge of excitement floods through me. Why hadn't I considered this earlier? It's unnecessary for me to confess. I won't face disbarment or be forced to decide between my most cherished friend and my family's financial security. The solution is transparent, and it has been present the entire time. Absolutely! I exclaim. Absolutely! We simply need to make her understand our perspective, and she may reconsider the wedding. Inspiration strikes. Hey, do you think you could host Lanier's bachelorette party during the camp weekend the weekend after next? Mary Stuart assents. Certainly. About Lanier? With a lighthearted tone, I suggest that Lanier is only unable to make it on two weekends, although I notice Mary Stuart's mind has wandered, her eyes reflecting a distant look. I mirror her focus across the pool to Ted. She gasps quietly. Her expression contorts in shock as she regards me. I am now part of the Hoffenmeyer family. I grin. Ted and Mary Stuart seem incongruous. Ted is modest, a tad plump, and matches Mary Stuart's height precisely when she isn't wearing elevated heels. Even though she declined his proposal for a first date for several weeks after they encountered each other during a magazine inauguration event that Mary Stuart was orchestrating and Ted attended, he pursued her unyieldingly. When he eventually succeeded in capturing her attention, he venerated her.","Maybe I should just let it go. However, whether Lanier chooses to move on is a decision she has the right to make. Do you think we could separate them? Mary Stuart asks out of the blue. Everything within me ignites. Why didn’t I think of this before? I don’t have to tell the truth. I don’t have to get disbarred or choose between my closest friend and my family’s security. The solution is so apparent, and it has been there all along. Yes! I reply. Yes! We simply need to make her realize what we see, and she’ll cancel the wedding. This sparks an idea in my mind. Hey, could you do Lanier’s bachelorette party at camp the weekend after next? Mary Stuart nods. Definitely. Can Lanier? I’ll say that Lanier has only two weekends she can't make work, but I can tell Mary Stuart's thoughts have drifted elsewhere, her eyes dreamy. I follow her gaze across the pool to Ted. She draws in her breath sharply. She turns to me, her expression twisting in shock. I just became a Hoffenmeyer. I grin. Ted and Mary Stuart are somewhat mismatched. Ted is average-looking, a bit overweight, and exactly Mary Stuart’s height when she’s not wearing heels. She didn’t accept his invitation for a first date for weeks after they met at a magazine launch event Mary Stuart was organizing and Ted was attending. But Ted pursued her relentlessly and, once he finally won her over, he adored her.","Maybe I should allow it to go. But whether Lanier allows it to go is really a choice she gets to produce. What about we break them up? Mary Stuart suddenly asks. Everything inside of me illuminates. Why haven't I thought of the? I don't have to inform the truth. I don't have to get disbarred or select between my absolute best buddy and my relatives security. The answer is so self-evident, and it had been right there all along. Yes! I say. Yes! We simply allow her to notice what we observe, and she'll name off the wedding. This gives me an idea. Hey, would you do Laniers bachelorette celebration at camp weekend after the next? Mary Stuart nods. For sure. Can Lanier? I am likely to declare that Lanier has only two weekends she absolutely can't make work, but I'm able to visit Mary Stuarts mind has floated somewhere else, her eyes glassy. I follow her gaze across the pool to Ted. She sucks in her breath. She glances at me, her face scrunching in horror. I just turn into a Hoffenmeyer. I grin. Ted and Mary Stuart are kind of a mismatch. Ted is plain, a little chubby, and precisely Mary Stuarts height when she actually is not wearing heels. She didn't conceive of his offer of a first night out for weeks after they met at a book launch party Mary Stuart was coordinating and Ted was attending. But Ted chased her relentlessly and, once he finally caught her, he worshipped her.","Perhaps this situation requires me to adapt. Yet, the decision to disband the union rests ultimately with Bethany. Could we manipulate events to favor their split? This thought strikes Mary abruptly, casting a spark of optimism within me. An opening? I realize with unexpected joy. I can dodge the penalty of perjury and dodge the choice between my loyal friends or maintaining my family's security. Her intentions are clear, and she stumbles upon the truth as though it had been within arm's reach all along. With sheer exuberance, I proclaim, ""Yes! Yes!"". We'll simply persuade her to see things from our viewpoint, and she'll annul the engagement. This brings to mind an idea. Hey, imagine hostings Bethany's hen do at a country camp retreat just a fortnight from now? Bethany nods enthusiastically at my suggestion. Definitely, though does Bethany agree to this? I plan to mention to Bethany that she has only two Saturdays that are out of bounds, but I sense Mary Sue's thoughts drifting off as she stares distant towards Trent. Her gaze thickens with apprehension before refocusing on me, fear visibly etched in her expressions. I've inadvertently become a 'haven for Trent', it seems. I grin despite my surprising revelation. There may have been some misgivings between Trent and Mary Sue — Trent's stoic demeanor contrasted by Mary Sue's grand presence, especially when not dolled up in heels, and it had taken him weeks to win over Mary Sue after they'd briefly met at a magazine unveiling that Mary Sue had overseen. Nevertheless, once he did gain her attention, Trent seemed determined to prove his devotion to Mary Sue."

The top-secret case documents expose their world as a dark sanctuary of self-righteous deceit, cruelty, brutality, and atrocities committed as casually as Onan discharged his seed into the soil of Judea. Dr. Gifford Calaphas, elder sibling of Durand, was a prominent and much esteemed virologist whose exploration was in part funded by the National Institutes of Health. Judging by all evidence, I believe he was a fair and honest man.","Those who steer the ISA are relentless individuals, both men and women of great ambition and fervor in their ideology. They stand by the belief that the desired outcome warrants extreme measures; in their eyes, acts considered evil, especially when sanctioned in the name of their cause, are not only excusable but also embody true bravery. The clandestine dossiers of their covert operations paint a sinister yet mesmerizing picture of deceit, cruelty, and violence, with heinous deeds carried out with an air of indifference. Dr. Gifford Calaphas, the older sibling of Durand, was a renowned virologist, highly esteemed for his contributions to the field, which included partial funding from the National Institutes of Health. His reputation as a scientist was impeccable, marked by integrity and dedication to the truth."

Do you think it was Marcus Barnes's firearm used in the tragedy? I inquired. Indeed, it was. And you're confident beyond a doubt that it's the one responsible for her death? I gulped, trying to steady my nerves. Well, we're lacking the bullet to confirm ballistics, but honestly, what other reason could there be for that gun to end up in the pond?

Again, a roar of laughter. Clytemnestra doesnt understand the joke. Though she has grown up among vulgar warriors, she has never heard men speak like this. They usually joke about fucking goats and pigs or challenge each other out of nothing. Tyndareus doesnt join in with the laughter, but he does nothing to stop it. How old was she? Penelope asks politely. Twelve. Diomedes shrugs. Timandra stirs next to Tyndareus, suddenly aware of her own age.","The men find Diomedes' comments very funny.

Clytemnestra doesn't understand why this is humorous. Although she grew up around crude warriors, she has never heard men talk this way before. Usually their jokes involve animals and meaningless challenges. Tyndareus does not laugh along, but he does not stop the laughter either. Penelope politely asks how old Diomedes' bride was, and he replies that she was twelve years old. ","This causes the men to laugh even more. Diomedess face turns red once more, this time with amusement. My father didnt even lay eyes on his bride until the day of their wedding, he remarks. She had never ventured outside the house. Once again, a burst of laughter fills the room. Clytemnestra is puzzled by the jest. Despite growing up surrounded by rough warriors, she has never heard men converse in this manner. They typically engage in banter about intimate relations with animals or play pointless challenges with one another. Tyndareus refrains from joining in the laughter, but he does not intervene to halt it. How old was she? Penelope inquires politely. Twelve. Diomedes gestures nonchalantly. Timandra beside Tyndareus shifts uneasily, suddenly conscious of her own age.","This elicits more laughter from the men. Diomedes' face reverts to red yet again, this time due to amusement.

Typically, their jests revolve around crude sexual innuendos or boasting without provocation. Tyndareus does not contribute to the laughter, yet he fails to quell it. How old was she? Penelope inquires politely. He was twelve, Diomedes responds, shrugging. Timandra shifts next to Tyndareus, becoming acutely conscious of her own age.","This elicits more laughter from the men.

Now, as Kai contemplated the unexpected encounter with Fiona, he couldn't help but wonder if her return was orchestrated rather than spontaneous. She claimed to have first laid eyes on him in the lobby of his building when she was canvasing for an interior design contract, and later, she found him on a dating platform with a highly precise location filter. At the time, it appeared nothing more than a serendipitous confluence of circumstance. After all, she reached out to him during a moment of personal desire; perhaps the allure of immediate pleasure clouded his judgment, making him less critical or cautious than he usually would be."

The tips are a lucrative opportunity.","Perhaps he's becoming complacent. May we take a moment? Marion inquired. Given that she had some time off from Radio City, timing was not an issue for her. Whatever you prefer. After he departed, Marion addressed Peter. I recognize he's not the nicest, though you might try to be a little more patient. Patient? The level of absurdity in this investigation is infuriating. However, if you press him too much, he might bar us from the case entirely. He's already unhappy about all the leads your involvement is generating. Somers appears to be very level-headed, whereas Ogden is quite bothersome. Those leads are incredibly valuable.","Maybe he's getting complacent. Do you mind if we wait a bit? asked Marion. Since it was her week off from Radio City, she didn’t have to stress about the time. Whatever works for you. After he left, Marion turned to Peter. I know he's difficult, but perhaps you could lighten up a little. Lighten up? The utter foolishness of this investigation is infuriating. But if you push too hard, he’ll shut us out entirely. He's already resentful of all the leads your profile is generating. Somers seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but this Ogden is a nuisance. The leads are a treasure trove.","Perhaps he's getting sluggish. Do you mind if we wait? asked Marion. Since it was her week off from Radio City, she didn't have to worry about the time. Whatever suits you. After he left, Marion turned to Peter. I know he's a jerk, but perhaps you could loosen up a bit. Loosen up? The sheer mouse-tweakliness of this investigation is exasperating. But if you press too hard, he'll exclude us entirely. He's already mad at all the leads your profile is generating. Somers seems to have his act together, but this Ogden is a pain in the neck. The tips are a gold mine.'='='-","Perhaps he's growing complacent. Would it be alright if we delayed our plans? Marion inquired. With her break from Radio City, she had the luxury of time. Whenever you're ready. After he departed, Marion turned to Peter. I understand he can be difficult, but perhaps you could show a bit more patience. Patience? The absurdity of this probe was infuriating. Yet, if we press too aggressively, he might cut us out entirely. He's already irked by the influx of leads your profile is generating. Somers appears to be shrewd, but Ogden is a challenge. The leads are like striking gold."

14512,"Professor Coker leaned forward. Include your middle name, since that was also your fathers name. People still pray with his name, you know, so they can have that kind of money. Im going to need that drink. tnba went to the mini fridge that sat next to his desk. He took his time fishing out a bottle of beer. He wasnt surprised that Coker had come to him. Everyone talked about how much money tnbas father had in his lifetime, but few considered how diminished the assets were once they were split thirty-something ways. Not that tnba was destitute. He had inherited enough cash to last him decades of no work, and on top of that, he had worked hard. Switching from legal practise within two years of being called to the bar, hed set up a company to import sundry supplies for government offices. The military was still in power when he started the company, and his brother had connected him to all the right people who could approve his proposals. Business slowed for a while when the military left power. He even ran the company in the red for over a year before understanding how the new power brokers in Abuja operated. Think of it as an investment, Professor Coker said as tnba returned to his seat. Is Fsjaiy not running for this same governorship seat? Look, I have the party chairmans backing. He told me this personally, thats why I went to pick up the form.","The educator leaned forward. Please provide your middle designation, since that was also your father's appellation. Individuals still appeal with his name, you comprehend, so they can obtain that kind of wealth. I'm going to require that beverage. tnba proceeded to the mini cooling box that stood adjacent to his desk. He took his time fishing out an ale bottle. He wasn't astonished that Coker had come to him. Everyone conversed about the extent of wealth tnba's father had in his lifetime, but few pondered how decreased the assets were once they were split thirty-something directions. Not that tnba was impoverished. He had acquired enough cash to last him decades sans work, and atop that, he had endeavored hard. Transitioning from lawful practice within two years of being summoned to the bar, he'd instituted a company to import assorted supplies for governmental offices. The military was still in authority when he originated the company, and his brother had linked him to all the accurate individuals who could sanction his propositions. Business slowed for a while when the military left authority. He even operated the company in the red for over a year before comprehending how the new authority brokers in Abuja maneuvered. Regard it as an investment, Professor Coker uttered as tnba returned to his seat. Is Fsjaiy not sprinting for this same governorship position? Observe, I have the party chairman's support. He informed me this in person, that's why I went to pick up the form.","Professor Coker leaned in. Include your middle name, as it was also your fathers name. People still pray using his name, you know, hoping for that kind of success. Im going to need that drink. tnba headed to the mini fridge sitting beside his desk. He took his time selecting a bottle of beer. He wasn't surprised that Coker had sought him out. Everyone spoke of how wealthy tnbas father was during his lifetime, but few realized how much the assets diminished once divided amongst more than thirty people. Not that tnba was penniless. He had inherited enough money to last him for decades without working, and on top of that, he had put in a lot of effort. Shifting from legal practice within two years of being admitted to the bar, he established a company to import various supplies for government offices. The military was still in control when he launched the company, and his brother had introduced him to all the influential individuals who could authorize his proposals. Business slowed down for a period after the military regime ended. He even ran the company with losses for over a year before grasping how the new power players in Abuja operated. Think of it as a strategic move, Professor Coker remarked as tnba settled back into his seat. Is Fsjaiy not also running for this same governorship position? Look, I have the support of the party chairman. He personally assured me of this, which is why I went to collect the application form.","Professor Coker leaned forward. Incorporate your middle name, given as it was your father's too. People still invoke his name in prayer, you know, wishing for a similar fortune. I could use that drink. Searching for a bottle among the mini fridge next to his desk, tnba took his time. His visit was no surprise, given the storied wealth of his father over the years, but few consider the diluted inheritance, split among numerous relatives. tnba isn't impoverished; his substantial inheritance is enough to sustain decades of inactivity, coupled with his industrious spirit. After securing a legal practice within two years of being admitted to the bar, he founded a company for import of various supplies for government offices during a period when the military was in power. His brother gave him access to the right figures who could validate his proposals. The pace of business slowed when the military dislodged, and tnba even managed his company through a financial downturn for over a year. Think of it as an investment, Professor Coker stated as tnba returned to his seat. Is Fsjaiy vying for this seat too? It's clear the party chair has my backing. He personally informed me, therefore I gathered the necessary papers.","Professor Coker leaned forward. Include your middle name, as it was also your father's name. People still pray with that name, you know, so they can gain that kind of wealth. I'm going to need that drink. TNBA walked over to the mini-fridge sitting next to his desk. He took his time retrieving a bottle of beer. He wasn't surprised that Coker sought him out. Everyone discussed how much money TNBA's father had amassed over his lifetime, but few took into account how the assets decreased when they were divided among thirty or so people. It didn't mean TNBA was destitute. He inherited enough money to last him decades without working, and on top of that, he worked diligently. He transitioned from practicing law within two years of being called to the bar, and he established a company that imported supplies for governmental offices. The military was still in power when he started the company, and his brother introduced him to the right people who could approve his proposals. Business slowed down when the military left power. He even ran the company at a loss for over a year before understanding how the new power brokers in Abuja operated. Think of it as an investment, Professor Coker said as TNBA returned to his seat. Isthaij isn't running for this same governorship seat, right? Look, I have the party chairman's support. He told me this himself, which is why I picked up the form today.","Professor Coker leaned closer, ""Provide your middle name, as it was also your father's name. People still invoke his name in prayer, hoping to receive similar wealth. I'll need that drink."" He ambled towards the mini fridge next to his desk, grabbing a bottle of beer without surprise that Coker had requested his presence. Many discussed the fortune accumulated by tnba's father during his lifetime, but few acknowledged how the assets were diluted upon division among numerous heirs. Not that tnba struggled financially. He inherited sufficient funds for many years of uninterrupted leisure, and in addition, he had worked diligently. Leaving the legal profession just two years after being admitted to the bar, he formed a company to import assorted supplies for government offices. The government was still in control when he established the company, and his brother had facilitated introductions to key figures who could approve his proposals. Business dwindled somewhat after the government transferred power. Adversely, he managed the company at a loss for over a year before figuring out the inner workings of the new decision-makers in Abuja. ""Consider it an investment,"" Professor Coker explained as tnba resumed his seat. ""Is Fsjaiy not running for the very same governorship seat? I have the party chairman's backing. He informed me personally, which is why I went to pick up the nomination forms.""","Professor Coker leaned forward. Include your middle name, as it also bears your father's name. Many still pray for such blessings, you know, so they can acquire financial prosperity. I'm going to need that drink. He walked over to the mini fridge beside his desk. He took his time retrieving a cold beer. He wasn't surprised that Coker had sought his counsel. Everyone discusses the immense wealth his father amassed during his lifetime, but few consider how the assets diminished once divided among dozens of heirs. Not that TNBA was financially insolvent. He had inherited sufficient funds to last him decades of idle lifestyle, and he had also worked diligently. He switched from law practice within two years of being called to the bar, establishing a company to import miscellaneous supplies for government offices. The military was still in power when he started the company, and his brother introduced him to the right contacts who could approve his proposals. When the military relinquished power, business slowed. He operated the company at a loss for over a year before learning how to navigate the new power brokers in Abuja. Think of it as a strategic investment, Professor Coker said as TNBA returned to his seat. Isn't FSJaiye running for this same governorship seat? Look, I have the party chairman's blessing. He told me this personally, which is why I acquired the nomination form.","Professor Coker leaned forward. Append your middle name, since that was also your father's moniker. Individuals still invoke his name in prayers, you are aware, as they wish to emulate his financial success. I'm going to need that drink. tnba approached the small refrigerator beside his desk. He deliberately retrieved a can of soda. He was not taken aback by Coker's presence. Though many had discussed the wealth that tnba's parents amassed, few pondered the reduction in assets dispersed among multiple heirs. Nevertheless, tnba was not left wanting. He inherited sufficient funds to sustain him for many years without labor, but his industrious nature had never waned. Escaping the realm of legal practice shortly after admission to the bar, he established a firm responsible for importing various goods for civil service departments. The military's presence fortuitously coincided with the inception of his business. A familial connection brokered by his brother provided access to influential contacts essential for endorsing his business plans. Post military departure, the enterprise experienced a temporary slump. He even endured a period of financial loss until he adapted to the preferences of the key decision-makers in Abuja. Professor Coker suggested pondering it as a worthwhile venture. Isn't Fsjaiy vying for this same gubernatorial candidacy? Given the circumstances, I required that form. I personally received assurances from the party chair, that's why I sought it out.","Professor Coker leaned in closer. Include your middle name, since that was also your father’s name. People still invoke his name, you know, hoping to attract that kind of wealth. I’m really going to need that drink. Tnba walked over to the mini fridge that sat beside his desk. He took his time retrieving a bottle of beer. He wasn’t surprised that Coker had approached him. Everyone discussed how much money Tnba’s father had amassed during his life, but few considered how diminished the assets were once divided thirty-something ways. Not that Tnba was impoverished. He had inherited enough funds to last him years without work, and on top of that, he had worked diligently. Transitioning from legal practice within two years of being called to the bar, he established a company to import various supplies for government offices. The military was still in power when he launched the business, and his brother had linked him with all the right people who could approve his proposals. Business slowed temporarily when the military lost power. He even operated the company at a loss for over a year before grasping how the new power players in Abuja functioned. Think of it as an investment, Professor Coker said as Tnba returned to his chair. Is Fsjaiy not running for this same gubernatorial seat? Look, I have the party chairman's support. He told me that personally; that’s why I went to get the form.","Professor Coker tilted forward. Include your centificial name, since that was also your father's name. People still pray with his name, you realize, so they can have that sort of money. I'm going to require that beverage. tnba strolled to the mini-fridge that settled below his desk. He took his time rummaging through a bottle of beer. He wasn't surprised that Coker had approached him. Everyone discussed how much money tnbas father had in his lifetime, yet few thought about how diminished the assets were once they were split thirty-some ways. Not that tnba was destitute. He had inherited enough cash to last him decades of do-nothing, and in addition, he had worked hard. Changing from legal practice within two years of being called to the bar, he had established a company to import seemingly supplies for government offices. The armed forces was still in power when he began the company, and his brother had linked him to all the right people who could authorise his proposals. Business slowed for a while when the military vacated power. He even ran the company in the red for more than a year before comprehending how the new power brokers in Abuja operated. Take into account, I have the party chairmans support. He told me this in person, which is why I went to gather the form.""","Professor Coker leaned in with a knowing look. ""Remember to use your paternal grandfathers name on your application,"" he advised, ""as it's a tradition for people to invoke it when seeking prosperity. It carries weight and could be beneficial for your endeavors. I see you're heading to the fridge. Care for a drink? I'll join you.""

Tnba nodded and retrieved a bottle of soda from the mini fridge that stood beside Professor Coker's desk. He wasn't taken aback by Coker's visit; he was well aware of the legendary wealth his father had amassed. Yet, he knew that inheritance had been divided among numerous heirs, leaving less than some might have assumed. Despite this, tnba wasn't struggling. He had received a substantial sum from his father and had parlayed that into a successful venture. By abandoning the legal profession just two years after being called to the bar, he had launched a business importing various supplies for government offices. His timing was fortuitous; the military was in power, and his well-connected brother facilitated introductions with key decision-makers.

Even after the transition of power, tnba's company persevered, though it operated at a loss for over a year. It was a period of learning the ropes in the new political landscape of Abuja. ""Consider it a long-term investment,"" Professor Coker mused as tnba settled back into his seat. ""Is it true that Fasuyi is also vying for the governorship?"" he probed. ""I've got the party chairman's backing, and he assured me of his support. That's why I've gone ahead and picked up the nomination form.""

I'm not certain if I want to, but being aware that Huff and I are at least inhaling the same atmosphere once more makes everything and anything feel alright.","You could have reprimanded me. I would have accepted it. I shrug. Frankly, I believe it would have troubled him less.

A rapping at the door drew a smile from Rawain. Ah, the last member of our company has arrived. The door opened, and I glimpsed the identical alarm on Wes and Jerus faces seconds before Vaun entered the room. The Nizahl guardsman bowed deeply.

He leaned casually against the fridge, a hint of concern in his eyes. I've come to despise this job. No, it's you who feels that way. I'm just venting. This dreadful job is suffocating. I keep asking myself why I ever walked through these doors. And my night courses are a constant reminder of paths I never took—paths I regret not exploring. The tension in my hands made it impossible to tear open the plaster packet, my mind a whirlwind of chaos. Just when I thought I had a grip on my reality, it unraveled once more. The accidental death of Shane in this very house didn't add up; it was a mystery. Then, my mother's revelation about her adoption, casting doubt on the very fabric of my understandings. Now, Madame Bowden, I know you think my concerns are exaggerated, but this is all beyond peculiar! This isn't normal, I insisted, my hands trembling, as I abandoned the plaster. What I detest the most is the relentless struggle to suppress my true desires, out of fear of another heartbreak. Henry stood there, a silent witness, as I unloaded the jumbled tumult of my thoughts. There was a pause, and for a fleeting moment, I hesitated, wondering if I should have kept those confessions to myself."

'And he would likely scold me for being an insensitive fool.' They relax back into their seats, sipping their beverages, but Jo realizes something has changed. She contemplates her mother, clinging to the belief that Uncle Wilbur will recuperate. Is it so improper to desire that things remain unchanged? She decides to make a resolution about her future after the New Year. She is quite sure where she will be, but has yet to determine what she will do (or who she will become, beyond being Auntie Jo). But for now she might as well delight in the Christmas season (only two weeks away) and put all else from her thoughts.

She thinks of her mother, clinging to the hope that Uncle Wilbur will recover. Is it considered wrong to desire things to stay the same? She decides to make a choice about her future in the upcoming year. She is quite sure of where she will be, but currently she has no clue about what she will be doing (or even fully understanding her identity, besides being Auntie Jo). In the meantime, she might as well savor the days leading up to Christmas (it is just a couple of weeks away) and push all else from her thoughts. She is about to confide this with Ruth and Malcolm, when Malcolm places his glass down. It seems like such a long time ago now.

They comfortably recline in their chairs, sipping their drinks, but Jo perceives a change has occurred. She envisions her mother clung to the notion that Uncle Wilbur would restore to health. Is it inherently unethical to aspire to maintain things as they are?    She decides to make a determination about her upcoming year. She largely understands her future landscape, but currently, she hasn't a clue what she'll be doing (or precisely who she'll be, beyond becoming Auntie Jo). But for now, she could just appreciate the approach to Christmas (it's merely two weeks away) and abstain from contemplating everything else. She's nearly prepared to divulge this to Ruth and Malcolm, when Malcolm sets his glass down. It feels like times past. I could genuinely believe that were I to adopt those two as my benchmarks, I would learn to be a different person.

We have the three of us.’ He turns to Ruth. And he would also scold me for my thoughtless ways.’   They relax in their seats, taking sips of their beverages, but Jo senses a change in the atmosphere. She recalls her mother, clinging to the hope that Uncle Wilbur will recover. Isn't it natural to desire to preserve things as they are?   She decides to make a decision about her life in the upcoming year. She is quite certain where she will be moving, but as of now, she is still clueless regarding what she will be doing (or rather, who she will be, beyond being Auntie Jo). But for now, she might as well indulge in the holiday spirit (it is only two weeks until Christmas). She is about to confide her feelings to Ruth and Malcolm, when Malcolm sets down his glass. It seems like ages ago now. I truly believe that, if I adopt those two as my mentors, I will learn to transform myself into a different man.

And we have the three of us.’ He turns to Ruth. And I'm sure Uncle Wilbur would also give me a gentle reminder to be more considerate and thoughtful for being a tactless fool.’ They settle back in their chairs, and sip their drinks, but Jo senses that something has shifted. She thinks of her mum, holding onto the hope that Uncle Wilbur will recover. Is it so wrong to want to maintain the status quo?   She resolves to make a decision about her future in the New Year. She is fairly certain where she will be, but as yet she doesn't have the slightest idea what she will be doing (or quite who she will be, beyond being Auntie Jo). But for now, she might as well savor the countdown to Christmas (it's only two weeks away) and put everything else out of her mind. She is about to share her thoughts with Ruth and Malcolm, when Malcolm sets his glass down. It feels like an eternity ago.

And here we are.’ He then addresses Ruth. And he would similarly pledge me to promise to not be such a blunt individual.’ They recline in their seating, sample their beverages, but Jo perceives that there's been a change. She recalls her mother's continued hope that Uncle Wilbur will improve. Is it incorrect to desire for things to stay constant?    She determines to choose a path for her upcoming endeavors. She is fairly positive about her destination, although the specifics of her undertaking remain a mystery to her (and even her personal identity, beyond being the Aunt referred to as Jo). For the moment, however, she could savor the anticipation of the Christmas festivities (which are a mere fortnight away) and set aside all other concerns. She is on the verge of confiding this to Ruth and Malcolm when Malcolm sets down his glass. It feels as if eternities have passed since we last discussed it. I genuinely surmise that if I emulated the principles of George Eliot and... well... the sheer unconquerable spirit demonstrated by Issachar.","We have the present moment, in this rather cozy room ... and I must say, Joanne, this is the most relaxing chair ...’ Jo has provided him with Uncle Wilbur’s seat by the fireplace. And it's just the three of us.’ He turns to Ruth. And he would definitely give me a nudge for being a thoughtless idiot.’ They lean back in their chairs and sip their beverages, but Jo senses something has changed. She thinks of her mom, clinging to the hope that Uncle Wilbur will improve. Is it so wrong to wish to maintain the status quo? She resolves to make a choice about her future in the New Year. She is fairly certain she knows where she will end up, but for now, she hasn’t the slightest clue what she will be doing (or quite who she will become, besides being Auntie Jo).

I really do believe that if I took George Eliot and, well...""they courageously go, 'the courageous just go and do it, of Issachar'.""","In the present moment, within the warm and inviting room, Joanne has graciously provided Uncle Wilbur's prized armchair by the fire for their seating, and we three are gathered. George turns to Ruth with a moment of self-awareness, acknowledging he would Be chided by Jo for his insensitivity if she were there, for being a tactless fool. They all lean back, their drinks in hand, but Jo, with a keen sense, feels a subtle shift in the air. She reflects on her mother's unwavering hope that Uncle Wilbur would recover, pondering if it's so unreasonable to desire to maintain the status quo.

Determined to make a decisive move about her future in the upcoming year, Jo is confident about where she'll be, though the specifics of what she'll be doing—or who she'll become beyond being Auntie Jo—remain elusive. Yet, she decides to embrace the festive season leading up to Christmas, just two weeks off, and postpone her deeper contemplations for later. As she contemplates sharing her thoughts with Ruth and Malcolm, Malcolm interjects, his voice echoing a sentiment of transformation and learning from the exemplary character of George Eliot and the indomitable spirit of Issachar, as represented by the characters in the room.

Please note that the text you've provided appears to be a blend of original prose with elements reminiscent of George Eliot's writing and the biblical figure Issachar. I've maintained the context and the essence of the characters as you've presented them."

He just couldn’t hold everything together; taking care of me, dealing with his own broken heart and absorbing his patients’ problems was too much. He became quite reclusive, prioritizing time with me above everything else, including other people’s company and a career path. He took casual work that fitted around my school hours and holidays. ","I won't ask anything more about this today. I've already pressed him a lot on this subject for now. What's the point dwelling on it anyway? She's not here. She hasn't reached out. I'm clearly not part of her life anymore, and she's not part of mine. When she left, it changed Dad. In his own words, that was when he stopped being a general practitioner. He just couldn't manage everything - caring for me, dealing with his broken heart, and helping his patients. It was too much. He became quite withdrawn, making time with me his top priority over everything else, including socializing and career. He took casual jobs that fit around my school schedule and breaks.","I don’t need to ask any more questions. I've already talked to him enough about this subject for today. What difference does it make now anyway? She's not here. She hasn't been in contact. Obviously, I'm not part of her life, and she is not a part of mine. Her departure affected Dad. Those were his words. He's mentioned that was the moment he decided to stop working as a GP. He couldn't juggle everything anymore; caring for me, managing his broken heart, and dealing with his patients' issues became overwhelming. He became more withdrawn, prioritizing time with me over everything else, including socializing and his career. He picked up temporary jobs that allowed him to be available during my school hours and breaks.","I don't seek anything more. I've probed him sufficiently on this matter for the day. What's the difference at this point? She isn't here. She hasn't communicated. Clearly, I'm not integrated into her life, nor is she mine. Her departure altered Dad, particularly his words. He has divulged that it was then when he ceased being a general practitioner. The burden was just too overwhelming for him; managing my care, coping with his shattered emotions, and shouldering his patients' issues simultaneously was beyond his capacity. He became quite secluded, making my presence his sole priority, over and above everyone else's company and any career advancement. He took on casual work that accommodated my school schedule and vacations.","I don't request anything more. I've pushed him too far on this subject for one day. What does it matter now, though? She's not here. She's not in contact. Clearly, I'm not a part of her life, and she's not a part of mine. When she left, Dad changed. His words. He told me that was when he stopped being a GP. He couldn't hold everything together anymore; taking care of me, coping with his own broken heart, and absorbing his patients' issues was too much. He became quite withdrawn, prioritizing time with me over everything else, including socializing and pursuing a career trajectory. He took temporary work that accommodated my school schedule and vacations.","Regarding his situation, I cannot demand additional insights from him. I thought I had discussed enough concerning this matter during our discussion this day. Since she remains distant, both physically and in communications, it makes little significance as she possesses minimal effect on my own life or interests. Her decision to leave notably impacted father, as relayed by him himself. In those words, I was informed he ultimately relinquished his position as a family physician since he couldn't reconcile personal responsibilities towards his family alongside his professional practice that included overseeing our familial responsibilities and comforting himself while still managing an increased patient case load. Overcome by sadness and distancing himself socially to take care of myself, he devoted extensive time to family commitments with temporary gigs scheduling around my classes and holiday commitments instead of adopting a proactive professional agenda.","I've said all I need to say. I've pushed him far enough on this subject for one day. What's the point now, anyway? She's gone. We haven't heard from her in ages. It's clear I'm no longer a part of her life, and she's not a part of mine. Her departure had a profound impact on Dad. His words still echo in my mind - he told me that was when he gave up his medical practice. He couldn't cope with the stress of being a GP; taking care of me, dealing with his own heartache, and shouldering the burdens of his patients was too overwhelming. He became increasingly reclusive, prioritizing time with me above all else, including socializing with others and pursuing a career. He took on casual work that fit around my school schedule and holidays.","I harbor no further queries. I've sufficiently pressed him on this matter for today. Why continue now? She is absent. There has been no contact. I find myself detached from her world. She has no presence in mine. Her departure has transformed Pa. The change is evident in his parlance. He divulged that he ceased practicing as a family doctor following her exit. The burden of managing my care, processing his fractured grief, and absorbing his patient's issues overwhelmed him. He turned into a recluse, prioritizing quality time with me over social interactions and maintaining a professional trajectory. He pursued sporadic employment that could adapt to my academic schedule and vacation period.","I don’t request anything more. I’ve pushed him enough on this subject for one day. What does it matter now anyway? She isn’t present. She hasn’t reached out. I’m clearly not part of her life, and she is not part of mine. Her departure changed Dad. His expressions. He’s told me that was when he decided to stop being a GP. He just couldn’t manage everything; caring for me, coping with his own shattered heart, and absorbing his patients’ issues was overwhelming. He became quite solitary, prioritizing time with me above all else, including socializing and his career.

She's not here. She hasn't contacted me. I'm obviously not a part of her life, she's not a part of mine. Her leaving influenced Dad. His wording. He's told me that was when he stopped being a general practitioner. He just couldn't hold everything together - caring for me, handling his shattered heart, and dealing with the patients' issues seemed to be an excessive amount for him to handle; hence, he became quite reclusive, focusing his time with me over everything and anyone else's company and a professional route. He took casual work that suited around my school hours and vacations.""","I've made my point on this matter for today. It seems irrelevant now since she's absent. She's not responded, and clearly, she's detached herself from my life, as I am from hers. Her departure marked a significant change in Dad. His own description. He admitted that was when he stepped away from general practice. Managing his own grief while supporting me and shouldering the burdens of his patients became unbearably overwhelming. He retreated into solitude, preferring to spend his time with me over socializing and pursuing a more traditional career trajectory. He adapted his work to accommodate my academic schedule and school breaks."

By the way, the dogs could use some water, and oh, it's absolutely scorching today! I have to run. It was wonderful seeing you, Sarah.

Relieved to be leaving Sarah behind, she surprised herself by finding a newfound energy and hastened her pace to get back to the house.","""I'll certainly consider that advice. You're aware, the cats could use some water, and goodness, isn't it sweltering today? I really should go. It was wonderful seeing you, Mary. We'll catch up later.""

Relieved to part from Mary, she felt a fresh burst of energy and sprinted the remainder of the way back home.","“I will certainly keep that in mind.

You know, the pets are perhaps in need of a drink, and eagles are they sizzling hot today! I've got to go. It was grand to view you, Sarah. Call me later.” She shook the stroller, and the pets started moving. Unappreciative of being free of Sarah, she found her second wind and managed the stretch back to the house in a hurry.","“I appreciate your advice and will certainly consider it. The dogs seem parched, and indeed, it's quite a scorcher today. I must be off—it's been a pleasure catching up, Sarah. We'll chat more soon.

Kat glanced at a blonde woman sitting by herself in the shadow of the pulpit. Her elbows were propped on the table with her chin resting on her threaded fingers. The gold trim and tight fit of her black coat meant she had money, but such clothing was not in style with the nobility. Also, no proper woman would have put on that dark eyeshadow so heavily yet skillfully. And an heiress from Overspire wouldn't have worn her blonde hair in tight braids pulled straight back from her pale forehead - the rich didn't care for practicality.","The musicians had fallen silent following Jocozah’s exit from the stage.

The golden detail and fitted design of her jet-black coachman's coat suggested she was wealthier than the crowd, but such attire was outdated in the realm of the nobility. It was also uncommon for a woman of refined breeding to apply such dark, heavy eyeliner as this one did, yet it was executed with remarkable skill.

Hold on, let me locate the emergency number they provided on my itinerary. Collapse onto the hotel bed, cloaked in darkness and controlled temperature, and sear with embarrassment. Slip on my least-smelly outfit for the event, have a delightful time at the event, return to the hotel room, and futilely calculate the likelihood of digesting a meal without cursing the porcelain throne in the immediate future.","Arrive at the hotel, attempt not to come across harshly while explaining that I'm on a book tour, you know? So, my publisher has reserved the room? Does the hotel keep a card on file from publishers? I am aware you require a card for incidental charges, but taking mine at the moment would practically result in its combustion if it gets processed by your machine right now? Let me grab the emergency contact number provided on my itinerary. Retreat into a dark, temperature-regulated hotel room and stew in self-consciousness. Don an outfit that's potentially somewhat cleaner for the event, enjoy the event immensely, return to the hotel room, and do some private calculations to figure out if eating an actual meal is worth the risk of possibly experiencing digestive discomfort the following day, depending on if the universe has a plight against my gastrointestinal wellbeing.","Arrive at the hotel, try not to come across as a jerk while explaining that I’m on a book tour, you know? So my publisher arranged the room, right? You should have a credit card on file from them? I understand you need a card for incidentals, but mine could literally ignite if you swipe it in your machine right now? Hold on, let me locate the emergency number they provided on my itinerary. Collapse in a dark, climate-controlled hotel room and writhe with embarrassment. Put on my least-dirty outfit for the event, enjoy myself at the event, return to the hotel room, and attempt to do some gastrointestinal calculations to figure out whether I should try to eat a proper meal that might give me in-flight diarrhea the next day, depending on whether fate has decided to punish me.","Arrive at hotel, attempt to not sound like an arsehole while explaining that I'm presently on a book tour, you know? Due to this, my publisher booked the room? You should have a credit card on record with them? Imagine if you had to shell out for this since you'd need one to start a hold? I'm certain you've encountered a time when you hovered over a keyboard intending to insert your card, only to experience instant regret. Hide in the dark, temperature-controlled hotel suite and experience emotional repercussions. Put on the least dirty outfit from your luggage, attend the function, and have a delightful experience. Upon returning to the hotel room, change into a clean outfit, then attempt to perform an algorithm involving mathematical calculations to ascertain whether or not consuming a substantial meal will result in in-flight diarrhea the following day. If the gods have chosen to filter away the fate of intoxication, I may be subjected to digestive turmoil inside the jet.","Upon arriving at the hotel, maintain a polite demeanor as you clarify your situation: you're on a book tour, with your publisher handling the reservation. They've placed a credit card on file for incidentals, although it's currently frozen to any further use. Kindly request an alternative arrangement while you search for the emergency contact number provided in your itinerary. Once settled in your dark, climate-controlled room, change into the least soiled of your clothes for the evening's event. Enjoy the event and return to your room, where you ponder the delicate calculations of your digestive system to decide whether to risk a substantial meal, mindful of the possibility of in-flight gastrointestinal distress, a.k.a. the wrath of God."

I couldn't fathom the resilience that allowed me to survive. Across the years, I was hailed blessed, brave, determined, and fierce but internally, I didn't feel any of those traits.

So did the wheelchair, which it would take me a few more months to do without consistently, mostly due to pain and sheer fatigue. Sometimes, when I couldn't sleep, I still counted them. Seventeen scars. Seventeen times the knife had pierced through me and slid back out again. I still could not fathom how I had survived. People had remarked over the years that I had been fortunate, brave, determined, fierce. I hadn't felt like any of those things. Survival had never even crossed my mind as a possibility or a reality.","We were smiling; it was likely someone's suggestion that we do so, because I couldn't imagine us engaged in the activity spontaneously. Cassidy possessed the vibrant, thoroughly practiced smile of the mayor's daughter, accustomed to being photographed. Liv's smile was merely a gentle tug at the corners of her mouth, her hands tightly knotted together and her feet crossed at the ankle. She always exhibited a vague appearance in the photos surrounding those times. In the weeks following the attack, she descended into her initial major spiral; however, they were still struggling for a diagnosis and the medication we were receiving wasn't quite right yet, leaving her disconnected from herself. And I, of course, had a pitiable smile. The upward pull of my cheeks had only emphasized my sympathy. So did the wheelchair, which it would take me several more months to stop dependently upon, mostly due to pain and sheer exhaustion. Sometimes, when I couldn't sleep, I still counted them. Seventeen scars. Seventeen times the knife had plunged into me and deposited itself back out again. I still couldn't fathom how I had survived. People had told me over the years that I'd been fortunate, brave, determined, fierce. I hadn't felt like any of those things. Survival had never crossed my mind as a possibility or a concept.","We wore smiles, likely prompted by social expectation, as spontaneous joy was an unfamiliar notion to us. Cassidy donned a radiant, polished smile, the kind that came easily to her as the mayor's daughter, accustomed to the camera's glare. Liv's smile, in contrast, barely flickered—a tentative upturn at the edges, her hands entwined and her ankles crossed, a pose that often gave her a dreamy, somewhat abstracted appearance in photographs. Those photos captured her during a period of deepening despair following the assault. In the subsequent weeks, she spiraled into a serious emotional crisis, yet the medical community was still puzzling over a definitive diagnosis, and the medication she took was not yet optimized, leaving her feeling adrift from her true self.

As for me, my smile was one of sorrow. My face was still marked by the bandages on my cheek, not from the initial wound, but from the meticulous reconstructive surgeries aimed at mending the damaged nerves and muscles, efforts that had offered only a partial restoration of function. The asymmetry in my face added to the sympathy cast upon me. The wheelchair, once a constant companion, was slowly being phased out—a transition that took several more months, partly due to the unrelenting pain and the overwhelming fatigue that plagued me. On sleepless nights, I'd find myself recounting the evidence of my ordeal—seventeen scars, each a testament to the violence inflicted upon me. Despite the immense challenges, the mere fact that I was alive was something I grappled to comprehend. Over time, people would attribute my survival to blessings, courage, determination, and fierceness. Yet, in the immediate aftermath of my trauma, such sentiments were far from my thoughts. The concept of surviving had never registered as a plausible outcome until it had miraculously come to pass."

Simon was tempted to let him go, but he swallowed his pride and shook his head. Stay, he said, shutting his book. I cant focus anyway. I came to get a book of poetry for Martine, William explained as he drew deeper into the room. She says it helps with her English, but I think she just really likes poetry. Cringing, Simon debated opening up this particular topic, but he knew they would need to talk about it eventually. About your wife . . . William sighed. I know you think poorly of me. I didnt say that. You didnt have to. Its written all over your face. This was going to be harder than he thought, but Simon was determined to really talk to his brother. It had been too long since he had. Will you sit? William eyed him warily but did as requested. When he moved stiffly, wincing and touching a hand to his rib cage, Simon suddenly remembered what the physician had told him days ago. We need to talk about how you were wounded. Paling, William glanced at the slightly open door before he spoke. I hoped you would forget about that. You were nearly on your deathbed. Of course I wasnt going to forget about it.","Although the outcome was reasonably positive, there was still substantial stress present between the two gentlemen. I apologize for intruding, William uttered as he retreated a pace toward the exit. Simon felt the urge to let him take his leave, however he pushed aside his ego and shook his head in refusal. Please stay, he spoke while closing his book. I am unable to concentrate regardless. I came to fetch a book of poems for Martine, William clarified as he advanced deeper into the room. She claims it assists with her English abilities, however I believe she simply admires poetry. Wincing, Simon deliberated on raising this specific subject, but he was aware they would be required to discuss it eventually. Regarding your wife... William exhaled. I understand you think little of me. I never said that. You did not have to. It is evident across your expression. This was destined to be more troublesome than he assumed, however Simon was determined to genuinely converse with his brother. It had been excessive time since he had. Will you take a seat? William scrutinized him warily but obeyed the request. As he relocated rigidly, grimacing and touching a hand to his rib section, Simon abruptly reminisced what the doctor had informed him days prior.

William eyed him cautiously, complying with the summons.

This conversation was proving more difficult than he anticipated, but Simon was resolute on having a genuine discussion. It's been too long since we last spoke. Will you sit? William looked at him warily but did as he asked. When he moved stiffly, wincing and touching his rib cage, Simon recalled the doctor's words from days ago. We need to talk about your injuries. Pale, William glanced at the slightly open door before he spoke. I hoped you would forget about that. You were close to death, he said. Of course I wouldn't forget about it.","Despite everything going smoothly, there was still a palpable strain between the two of them. I didn't mean to intrude, William said, and he took a step back towards the exit. Simon was tempted to let him leave, but he swallowed his pride and shook his head. Stay, he said, closing his book. I'm having trouble concentrating anyway. I came to pick up a poetry book for Martine, William explained as he moved further into the room. She says it helps with her English, but I think she just genuinely appreciates poetry. Cringing, Simon debated opening up this particular topic, but he knew they would need to discuss it eventually. About your wife... William sighed. I know you have reservations about me. I didn't say that. You didn't have to. It's written all over your face. This was going to be tougher than he thought, but Simon was determined to really talk to his brother. It had been too long since they had. Will you sit? William eyed him warily but did as requested. When he moved stiffly, wincing and touching a hand to his side, Simon suddenly remembered what the doctor had told him days ago. We need to talk about how you were injured. Paling, William glanced at the slightly ajar door before he spoke. I hoped you would forget about that. You were at death's door. Of course I wasn't going to forget about it.","Despite the overall situation being fairly acceptable, there remained significant strain between the two individuals. ""I didn't mean to intrude,"" William remarked, and he retreated a bit closer to the exit. Simon struggled with the decision to let him leave alone, yet he suppressed his ego and shook his head. ""Stay,"" he insisted, closing his poetry anthology. ""I can't concentrate right now."" William elaborated to Simon that he had come to fetch a poetry anthology for his sister, Martine. She claims it aids her English studies, but he suspects she is simply an admirer of verses. Simon hesitated before broaching the sensitive subject, but he acknowledged that they would inevitably have to address it. Concerning your spouse . . . Walter responded with a sigh. ""I'm aware you hold me in low regard."" ""I didn't say that,"" William interjected. ""You didn't need to. It was evident on your visage."" This matter was proving to be more challenging than Simon had anticipated, yet he was resolved to engage in a genuine dialogue with his sibling, a goal he had aspired to for some time. ""Would you be willing to sit down with me?"" Will asked, with wary attention on Walter. When Walter obliged, shifting uncomfortably and grimacing as he placed a hand on his midsection, Simon instantly recalled what the doctor had shared with him several days earlier. ""We need to discuss the nature of your injuries,"" he gently reminded him. William, hesitatingly eyeing the ajar door before speaking, uttered, ""I had hoped we'd leave that behind."" Plagued by lingering health issues since his traumatic encounter, it was something he couldn't dismiss from his mind, and neither could she from her heart. This conversation would not only help them navigate their personal feelings but was vital for their relationship – a bridge between estranged hearts that","Although everything turned out fairly well, there was still a significant amount of tension between the two of them. I didn’t mean to interrupt, William said, taking a step back toward the door. Simon was inclined to let him leave, but he swallowed his pride and shook his head. Stay, he said, closing his book. I can’t concentrate anyway. I came to pick up a collection of poems for Martine, William explained as he stepped further into the room. She says it helps with her English, but I think she just really enjoys poetry. Cringing, Simon considered broaching this particular subject, but he knew they would have to discuss it eventually. About your wife... William sighed. I know you think poorly of me. I didn’t say that. You didn’t need to. It’s clear from your expression. This was going to be tougher than he anticipated, but Simon was determined to truly communicate with his brother. It had been far too long since he had. Will you sit? William regarded him cautiously but complied. When he moved awkwardly, wincing and touching his hand to his rib cage, Simon suddenly recalled what the doctor had told him days earlier. We need to discuss how you were injured. Turning pale, William glanced at the slightly ajar door before he spoke. I hoped you would forget about that. You were almost on your deathbed. Naturally, I wasn’t going to overlook it.","Although everything turned out relatively well, there was still a lot of stress between the two of them. I didnt mean to interrupt, William said, and he took a step back towards the door. Simon was tempted to let him go, but he swallowed his pride and shook his head. Stay, he said, shutting his book. I can't focus anymore. I came to get a book of poetry for Martine, William explained as he drew deeper into the room. She says it helps with her English, but I think she just really loves poetry. Cringing, Simon debated opening up this particular topic, but he knew they would need to talk about it eventually. About your wife . . . William sighed. I know you think poorly of me.

It had been too long since he had. Will you sit? William eyed him warily but did as requested. When he moved stiffly, wincing and touching a hand to his rib cage, Simon suddenly remembered what the physician had told him days ago. We need to talk about how you were wounded. Paling, William glanced at the slightly open door before he spoke. I hoped you would forget about that. You were nearly on your deathbed. Of course I wasn't going to forget about it.","Despite the situation concluding without major incident, an undercurrent of discord remained between the two. ""I apologize for my interruption,"" William offered, stepping back toward the exit. Simon considered letting the moment pass, but his sense of honor prevailed. ""Stay,"" he insisted, closing his book. ""Honestly, I can't concentrate right now, anyway."" William then delved further into the room, explaining his motives. ""I'm here to pick out a poetry collection for Martine. She claims it's to help with her English, but I suspect she's truly enamored with the art form."" Simon hesitated, contemplating whether to broach the subject. Yet, he realized it was inevitable. ""About your wife..."" William sighed heavily. ""I understand you might hold resentment towards me. But please, hear me out. It's not what you think."" Simon's determination to engage in a sincere conversation with his brother was unwavering. It had been far too long since their last genuine exchange. ""William,"" Simon implored, his voice firm yet empathetic. ""Please, sit down."" William eyed him cautiously but obliged. As he settled on the chair, wincing and gingerly touching his ribs, Simon was abruptly jolted back to the memory of the physician's words from several days prior. The realization hit William's face, and he glanced nervously at the slightly ajar door before speaking. ""I was hoping you'd forgotten about my condition. I was on the brink of death."" ""Forget it?"" Simon retorted, his expression stern. ""You think I could forget something like that?""

12957,"Id agreed to the ride only after I made her swear up and down that she would drop me at the dooronlyand not come up. But I have to get your prescriptions, she protested. I can get my own damn prescriptions, I insisted. But one guess for how the drop-off went down. Thats right. She picked up my prescriptions without permission and then came up to my hovel un-frigging-invited. I hadnt been home fifteen minutes when she showed up. I was still standing in the entryway, trying to adjust to the unfamiliar silence. Peanut was still being boarded. There was no jangle of tags or scuttling of dog paws as he scrambled to greet me at the door, wagging his tail so hard he bapped himself on the ears.","I reluctantly agreed to let her drive me home, but only if she dropped me off at the door and didn't come inside. She insisted on getting my prescriptions for me, even though I told her I could do it myself. Just as I predicted, she got the prescriptions without my permission, then came up to my apartment uninvited. I had only been home for 15 minutes when she arrived. I was still getting used to the quiet, since my dog Peanut was being boarded. There was no sound of his tags jangling or his paws running to greet me, his tail wagging so much that it hit his ears.","I agreed to the ride only after I made her promise firmly that she would leave me at the entrance and not come up. But I need to grab your medications, she objected. I can handle my own medications, I asserted. But you can probably guess how the drop-off played out. That's correct. She picked up my medications without asking and then came up to my humble abode without being invited. I had barely been home fifteen minutes when she appeared. I was still standing in the foyer, trying to adjust to the quietness. Peanut was still away. There was no sound of tags jingling or the sound of dog paws running to greet me at the door, wagging his tail so vigorously that he hit himself in the ears.","Initially, I reluctantly agreed to the ride under the condition that she vowed to only drop me off at the door and would not follow me inside. She argued, stating she needed to fetch my medications. I firmly countered, declaring that I could collect my own prescribed medicines. Here's a prediction about the drop-off: You're correct. Contrary to our agreement, she went ahead and collected my medications without authorization, then inconveniently visited my dwelling uninvited. By the time I had been home for about fifteen minutes, she arrived. Still standing in the entry, adjusting to the unusual quiet, Peanut wasn't home; I didn’t hear the familiar jingle of his tags or the sound of his paws scrabbling as he made his way to welcome me at the door, tail wagging so hard it collided with his ears.","I had consented to the ride only after making her promise that she would only drop me off at the door and not enter. But I have to get your prescriptions,"" she complained. ""I can get my own damn prescriptions,"" I insisted. ""But one guess how the drop-off went down. Correct! She grabbed my prescriptions without permission and then came up to my humble abode uninvited. I hadn't been home for fifteen minutes when she appeared. I was still in the entryway, attempting to acclimate to the unusual silence. Peanut was still staying with a boarding service. There was no clamor of tags or scampering of dog paws as he rushed to greet me at the door, enthusiastically wagging his tail and inadvertently bumping himself on the ears.","I agreed to the ride only after she swore she'd only drop me off at the door and not come up. But I must fetch my own prescriptions, she protested. However, I wasn't anticipating how the drop-off would transpire. Predictably, she picked up my prescriptions without consent and subsequently showed up unannounced at my dwelling. Upon arrival home, I was yet to hear the jingle of tags or the scampering of paws as Peanut eagerly greeted me, his tail wagging so vigorously it knocked against his ears.","I had agreed to the ride only after I made her promise to drop me off at the doorstep and not come any further. But I have to get my scripts, she protested. I can pick up my own damn scripts, I insisted. But one guess for how the drop-off went down. That's right. She picked up my scripts without permission and then came up to my humble abode unannounced. I hadn't been home five minutes when she showed up. I was still standing in the entryway, trying to acclimate to the unusual quiet. My dog, Peanut, was still at the kennel. There was no tinkle of tags or scuttle of paws as he scrambled to welcome me at the door, wagging his tail with such enthusiasm it whapped against his ears.","I consented to the ride solely after I persuaded her to swear profusely that she would dock me at the thresholdonly and avoid proceeding. Nevertheless, she asserted, I need to fetch your prescriptions. I can procure my own prescriptions, I contended. Yet, one might infer how the disembarking event transpired. Precisely. She covertly obtained my medication without consent and subsequently proceeded to my dwelling, much to my annoyance. I had barely settled into my abode for a quarter-hour when she unexpectedly appeared. I was still positioned in the portal area, struggling to acclimate to the unaccustomed hush. Peanut was still accommodated elsewhere. The silence was unbroken by the typical clinking of collars or pattering of dog claws as he eagerly scurried to welcome me, tail wagging fiercely causing a high-pitched noise as it smacked against his ears.","Id agreed to the ride only after I made her promise repeatedly that she would drop me off at the door and not come inside. But I need to get your prescriptions, she argued. I can retrieve my own damn prescriptions, I insisted. But take a guess at how the drop-off went. That's right. She collected my prescriptions without my consent and then showed up at my place completely uninvited. I hadn't been home for more than fifteen minutes when she arrived. I was still standing in the entryway, trying to adjust to the unusual silence. Peanut was still being boarded. There was no jingling of tags or pattering of dog paws as he rushed to welcome me at the door, wagging his tail so energetically that he smacked himself on the ears.","I consented to the ride only after I forced her to vow she would leave me at the door and not enter. But I need to acquire your prescriptions, she protested. I can buy my very own damned prescriptions, I insisted. But one guess for how the disrupt went down. That's right. She accepted my prescriptions without authorization and then came up to my hovel un-frigging-invited. I hadn't been home fifteen minutes when she showed up. I was still standing in the entryway, attempting to adjust to the unfamiliar silence. Peanut was still being boarded. There was no jangle of tags or scuttling of dog paws as he scrambled to greet me at the door, wagging his tail so hard he almost hit his head on them.``","I reluctantly agreed to the ride after personally ensuring that she promised to drop me off at my doorstep and not step inside. However, she insisted she needed to retrieve my prescriptions on her way. I shot back, asserting my independence, claiming I'd pick up my own medications. Unsurprisingly, she defied my wishes and, without seeking permission, picked up my prescriptions and then had the audacity to visit my home uninvited. She arrived before I could even settle in for ten minutes, despite being stationary in my entryway, still taking in the quiet and the absence of the usual greeting ceremony with Peanut, who was still at the kennel. There were no delightful sounds of tags clinking or the brisk pace of a happy dog coming to welcome me, just the stillness of an empty home."
